Talk about a game-changer! ✨

### Frontier Research

1.  Kosmos, the tireless new colleague, has arrived in the scientific community! This AI scientist can accomplish approximately six months of human workload in just a single run. Utilizing an innovative **structured world model**, it integrates papers, runs code, and proposes hypotheses within incredibly long contexts of over **ten million tokens**, already leading to multiple original scientific discoveries. To dive into this research paradigm-shifter, check out [this in-depth report (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/xiaohu-ai/kosmos-ai-6) or go straight to [its technical paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02824). Mind-blowing! 🤯

2.  Transformer Copilot presents a fascinating idea: imagine an AI model learning with a "copilot" sitting right next to it, specifically tasked with correcting its mistakes! Researchers designed this "Copilot" model to learn from the "error logs" generated by the main model (Pilot) during fine-tuning, correcting its inference results in real-time. This novel "master-apprentice" framework teaches AI to reflect and improve, significantly boosting its performance across multiple benchmarks. Pretty neat, right? ✨

3.  AI voice systems: Can they really pick up on human social cues? An [an interesting paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10693) discovered that when asked to speak "politely and formally," top-tier AI voice systems unconsciously slow down their speech, perfectly mimicking human behavior. This shows that AI isn't just learning language; it's subtly absorbing our complex social and cultural nuances. It's quietly transforming from a mere tool into a "social actor" that truly understands the room. How wild is that? 🗣️

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  Meta executives are staying cool amidst worries about an AI investment bubble. They calmly stated that while a $72 billion annual expenditure sounds wild, everything is totally under control. They believe this massive investment isn't some crazy gamble but a strategic play for the future, already showing real returns through their advertising and recommendation systems. As [this report](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22835) from Goldman Sachs points out, compared to historical tech waves, our current investment is nowhere near "out of control." 😎

2.  Privacy: Are we trading it for AI's convenience? A community discussion revealed a harsh truth: most people are willing to sacrifice data sovereignty for convenience. The core of [this debate](https://newshacker.me/story?id=45947434) revolves around the power abuse of centralized AI and the challenges of auditing it. While **local models** offer a glimmer of hope, hardware limitations and platform ecosystem barriers mean the path to privacy protection is still a long and winding one. Something to chew on, right? 🤔

3.  Andrej Karpathy made a brilliant analogy: AI isn't electricity; it's **Software 2.0**, and its automation superpower lies in **verifiability**. As [this excellent summary (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1990216296311779512) explains, tasks whose results can be quickly and objectively evaluated (like programming and math) will be automated first. Meanwhile, domains involving creativity, strategy, and other hard-to-quantify areas will remain human intellectual strongholds for the foreseeable future. Food for thought! 🧠
