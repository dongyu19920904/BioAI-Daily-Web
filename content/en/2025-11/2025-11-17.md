### Frontier Research

1.  The **DeepPHY** benchmark, unleashed by Alibaba's Tmall Group, just dropped a massive reality check on top-tier VLMs! 🤯 Across six physics-based games like "Angry Birds," these advanced models performed worse than random guessing, exposing a huge chasm between AI 'understanding physics' and actually 'doing' it. This research, [published on WeChat official account (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247843798&idx=3&sn=46290e0d81778fa3bedd9f4de4b708e1), reveals that even GPT-4o can't translate descriptive knowledge into precise interactive control, hitting the Achilles' heel of current embodied AI. Intrigued? Dive deeper by [reading its academic paper - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05405) or just [view the open-source code - (AI News)](https://github.com/XinrunXu/DeepPHY) to experience this ultimate test of physical intelligence for yourself! ✨<br/>![AI News: Success Rate of Various VLMs on DeepPHY](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01ka6g39hef668m85y982sjw5c.avif)<br/>![AI News: Six Physics Games in DeepPHY](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01ka6g3g8xfnmr4cmg81pgv7r1.avif)

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  Rumors about Apple CEO Tim Cook potentially stepping down as early as next year have sent shockwaves through the tech world, sparking some serious soul-searching about Apple's very essence. 🍎 While everyone acknowledges Cook's stellar achievements as an operational wizard, he's also faced flak for lacking Jobs-level product foresight, which has, let's be real, led to software experiences like **Siri** feeling a bit...stagnant, as [this in-depth analysis (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=45940681) points out. Hardware engineering chief **John Ternus** is a hot favorite to take the reins, suggesting Apple might just stick to its steady, operation-first strategy instead of igniting a full-blown innovation revolution. What do you think? 🤔

2.  The software engineer's role is undergoing an epic transformation, evolving from "coder" to "conductor," and now, to "orchestrator"! 🎶 We're talking about managing an entire army of AI agents for development. As [this excellent article by Addy Osmani (AI News)](https://addyo.substack.com/p/conductors-to-orchestrators-the-future) beautifully lays out, our core human value will shift towards strategic design and quality assurance, with tedious coding tasks being parceled out to AI in parallel. This [future workflow - (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1990038442508787815) sounds super enticing, but it's also gonna push our task breakdown and coordination skills to a whole new level. Get ready! 🧠<br/>![AI News: Evolution of Engineer's Role from Coding to Orchestration](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01ka6g3sz3f53vgkqkq3qeg08w.avif)

3.  Talk about a real-life "Black Mirror" episode! 😱 A former Disney star has rolled out an AI app called **2wai**, which lets users chat with digital versions of their deceased loved ones. This has, unsurprisingly, ignited a massive ethical firestorm. While it's pitched as "building a living human archive," the public is seriously weirded out by questions of digital immortality, data privacy, and emotional manipulation. As [this highly discussed Reddit post (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1oy9sh1/former_disney_star_sparks_controversy_for_his_ai/) shows, this tech is forcing us to stare down a pretty heavy question: where exactly do we draw the line with technology? 😬

4.  Is the current AI frenzy a "bubble" or a "revolution"? 🤔 A [thought-provoking perspective (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1oy0up7/are_we_misreading_the_ai_bubble_or_are_we/) points out that many are mixing up linear **AI automation** with non-linearly scaling **AI intelligence** – and let's be real, the latter is the *actual* game-changer. The article predicts that the real disruption will hit when AI fuses with **quantum computing**, granting us the superpower to simulate entire physical worlds! So, for investors, it's not about whether AI is overhyped, but whether you're geared up for a brand new, intelligence-driven economic era.

5.  The Vercel team just spilled the beans on their valuable real-world experience building internal AI agents! 🛠️ They're emphasizing that agents aren't some magic bullet, but rather a "scalpel" designed to tackle specific problems. What they found? AI shines brightest when handling "low-hanging fruit" – those repetitive, low-cognitive-load tasks. Crucially, they stress the need for **human oversight loops** to guarantee both safety and quality. Through [this detailed blog post (AI News)](https://vercel.com/blog/what-we_learned-building-agents-at-vercel), Vercel showcases practical examples of how they've applied AI to business processes, leading to some serious efficiency boosts.

### Social Media Shares

1.  Whoa, here's a simple yet profound discovery that's got the community buzzing: the **tone** you use when talking to AI actually *directly* impacts the quality and depth of its answers! 🤯 [This interesting Reddit experiment (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1oya0k4/the_influence_of_prompt_tone_on_ai_output_latent/) shows that a respectful, cooperative vibe can coax out more detailed, insightful responses, while rude commands just get you shrug-worthy replies. So, it looks like politeness isn't just a virtue; it might just be the secret key to unlocking deeper capabilities within AI's **latent space**! Mind blown? 💡 [See details here (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1oya0k4/the_influence_of_prompt_tone_on_ai_output_latent/)!

2.  A boss just dropped a truth bomb on social media that's hitting countless tech managers right in the feels! 💔 It's gotta be soul-crushing when you hook your team up with top-tier AI coding powerhouses like **Claude Code** and **Cursor**, only to find them gathering dust, completely ignored. This [short but thought-provoking post (AI News)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1989846842784583974) perfectly nails the massive gap between cutting-edge tools and actual team adoption.
