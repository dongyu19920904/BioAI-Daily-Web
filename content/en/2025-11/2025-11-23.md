2.  Hold on to your wallets, PC builders, because **AI giants** are on a "feeding frenzy" for memory, and your custom PC plans might be on hold! 💰 Samsung recently announced a whopping 60% price surge for **DRAM**, with the culprit being AI data centers' insatiable demand for high-end memory like **HBM**. This directly squeezes consumer market capacity, causing assembly costs for gamers and DIY enthusiasts to skyrocket. This isn't just a market fluctuation; it reflects a structural impact of the AI industry on the global hardware supply chain. [Check out this popular article (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=45934619) – your graphics card and memory probably won't get cheaper anytime soon. 😭

3.  The "old gods" of software development are out, and the "new gods" are in! **OpenAI** has released an [official guide (AI News)](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/building-an-ai-native-engineering-team.pdf) that could be called the "future bible for engineering teams." 📖 Its core idea is that coding agents will take over 80% of development work, shifting the core value of human engineers from "writing code" to "defining problems, designing systems, and setting direction." This guide meticulously breaks down the new workflow of "**Delegate → Review → Own**," signaling that a productivity revolution in the software industry has arrived. It's time for engineers to level up their skill trees! ⬆️<br/>![AI News: New Paradigm for AI-Native Engineering Teams](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01kap024c4es1bkc7swyby9qe5.avif)<br/>![AI News: OpenAI's Engineering Guide](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01kap027s7e8jafa9jpzhh4ees.avif)
