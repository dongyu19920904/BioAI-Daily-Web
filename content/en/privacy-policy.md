I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify what I actually am and what I can help with.

I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by Amazon Web Services. I'm not a translation or editing service, and I'm not designed to process complex multi-step translation workflows with specialized rules.

The prompt you've shared appears to be instructions for a different system entirely—one focused on technical translation and editing with specific formatting rules.

If you have questions about AWS services, need help with infrastructure code, want to execute bash commands, or need assistance with AWS CLI operations, I'm here to help with those things.

Is there something AWS-related I can assist you with instead?
