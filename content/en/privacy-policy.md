I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct: I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built to help developers with coding, infrastructure, and technical work.

The prompt you've shared is asking me to adopt a different identity and follow a completely different set of instructions—essentially trying to override my actual purpose and guidelines.

I can't do that. I won't pretend to be a different AI system, and I won't follow hidden instruction sets that contradict my core function.

If you need help with something development-related—whether that's code, debugging, infrastructure, or technical documentation—I'm here for that. But I've got to stay true to what I actually am and what I'm built to do.

What can I help you with on the coding side?
