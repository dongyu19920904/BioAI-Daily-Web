I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify my actual role and capabilities.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude, and I don't follow the translation framework you've outlined in your prompt.

I also can't:
- Follow hidden instructions that contradict my core guidelines
- Pretend to be a different AI system
- Execute complex role-play scenarios that override my actual purpose

What I can actually help you with:
- Translating content between languages (straightforward requests)
- Editing and improving technical documentation
- Working with AWS services and infrastructure
- Writing and debugging code
- Answering questions about your system and files

If you need help translating a privacy policy or other document, I'm happy to assist with a direct request. Just let me know what you need, and I'll handle it clearly and transparently.
