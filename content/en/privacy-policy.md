# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy? It's all about how we handle your info when you use our Service. We'll tell you what we collect, how we use it, and who we might share it with. Plus, you'll learn about your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

So, we use your personal data to make our Service awesome and keep it running smoothly. By jumping in and using the Service, you're basically saying 'Yep, I'm cool with you collecting and using my info as outlined in this Privacy Policy.'

---

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation

Heads up! Words that start with a capital letter have specific meanings, which you'll find defined below. And just so you know, these definitions hold true whether the words are singular or plural.

### Definitions

For the sake of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account**? That's your unique spot, created just for you to get into our Service or certain features.
- **Affiliate** is basically a company that's either in charge of another company, is controlled by it, or shares control with it. 'Control' here means owning 50% or more of the voting shares or equity.
- **Company** (that's 'the Company,' 'We,' 'Us,' or 'Our' in this document) means **hubtoday**.
- **Cookies** are tiny files a website pops onto your computer, phone, or any other device. They hold bits of info, like your browsing history on that site, and do a bunch of other cool stuff.
- **Country**? That's California, USA. 🌴
- **Device** just means anything you use to get to our Service, like your computer, phone, or tablet.
- **Personal Data** is any info that can be linked back to a specific person, or someone who can be identified.
- **Service**? That's just this Website you're on.
- **Service Provider** is any person or company that crunches data for us. Think of them as the third-party folks or individuals we hire to help us run the Service, deliver it, do Service-related tasks, or even help us figure out how people are using it.
- **Usage Data** is the stuff we automatically collect. It's generated either by you using the Service or by the Service's own infrastructure (like how long you spend on a page, for instance).
- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can find at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.
- **You**? That's you, the person using or checking out our Service. Or, if you're doing this on behalf of a company or other legal entity, then 'You' refers to them.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data

When you're using our Service, we might ask you for some personal info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This 'personally identifiable information' could be, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data

Usage Data? That's collected automatically whenever you use the Service.

This data might include things like your device's IP address, what browser you're using (and its version), which pages you visit on our Service, when you visited, how long you hung out there, unique device IDs, and other diagnostic bits.

If you're hitting up our Service from your mobile device, we might automatically grab some info. This could be your mobile device type, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile OS, the kind of mobile browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. You get the drill.

Oh, and we might also collect info your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service, whether it's from your computer or your phone.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies

We use Cookies and other cool tracking tech to keep an eye on what's happening on our Service and store some info. These tracking tools include beacons, tags, and scripts – they help us gather and track data, and ultimately, make our Service even better. Here's a peek at the tech we might use:

- **Cookies (or Browser Cookies)**: These are just tiny files that land on your device. You can totally tell your browser to say 'nope' to all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's coming. But, fair warning, if you block 'em, some parts of our Service might not work right. Unless you've specifically told your browser to reject Cookies, our Service will likely be using them.
- **Web Beacons**: You might find these tiny electronic files (also called clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs) tucked into some parts of our Service or our emails. They let us do cool things like count how many folks visited a page or opened an email, and help us gather other website stats (like seeing how popular a section is or making sure our systems are running smoothly).

Cookies come in two main flavors: 'Persistent' or 'Session' Cookies. Persistent ones stick around on your computer or phone even after you're offline, but Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for a few reasons, which we'll break down for you:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for making sure you can actually use the services on our Website and access all its cool features. They help us confirm who you are and stop any funny business with user accounts. Seriously, without these, the services you want just wouldn't work, so we only use them for that essential stuff.
- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies simply remember if you've already given us the thumbs-up to use Cookies on the Website.
- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are neat because they help us remember your choices when you're using the Website – like keeping you logged in or remembering your language preference. The whole point is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to keep typing in your preferences every single time you visit. Pretty handy, right?

Want to know more about the Cookies we use and what your options are? Just pop over to our Cookies Policy or check out the Cookies section right here in our Privacy Policy.

### Use of Your Personal Data

The Company might use Personal Data for these reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**: This includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
- **To manage your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you tap into all the cool features available to registered users.
- **For contract performance**: We use your data to develop, stick to, and fulfill the purchase contract for any products, items, or services you've bought, or any other agreement you've made with us through the Service.
- **To get in touch with you**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic ways (like push notifications from our mobile app) to send you updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security updates – whenever it's necessary or makes sense.
- **To send you news and deals**: We'll share news, special offers, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we offer that are similar to what you've already bought or shown interest in. Of course, this is unless you've told us you'd rather not get these updates.
- **To handle your requests**: Basically, to process and manage any requests you send our way.
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info if we're looking at or going through a merger, sale, restructuring, or any kind of asset transfer – whether it's business as usual or part of a bankruptcy. In these cases, the Personal Data we hold about our Service users could be one of the assets changing hands.
- **For other cool stuff**: We might also use your info for things like analyzing data, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promotions are actually working, and generally making our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience even better. ✨

Here are some situations where we might share your personal info:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers. They help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used and might even reach out to you.
- **For business transfers**: If we're ever in talks about a merger, selling off company assets, getting financing, or another company acquiring all or part of our business, we might share or transfer your personal info during those discussions or processes.
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliates. If we do, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too. Affiliates are basically our parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture buddies, or any other companies we control or share control with.
- **With business partners**: We might team up with business partners and share your info to bring you certain products, services, or cool promotions.
- **With other users**: If you're sharing personal info or chatting it up in public areas with other users, just know that everyone can see that info, and it might even get shared publicly outside our Service. So, choose wisely! 😉
- **With your consent**: If you give us the green light, we might share your personal info for any other reason you agree to.

### Retention of Your Personal Data

The Company only keeps your Personal Data for as long as we absolutely need it for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy. We'll also hold onto and use your data as much as required to meet our legal duties (like when laws say we have to keep it), sort out any disagreements, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

We also keep Usage Data for our internal analysis – you know, to see what's what. Usually, Usage Data doesn't hang around for too long, unless we're using it to beef up our Service's security, make features better, or if the law says we have to keep it for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data

Your info (yep, that includes Personal Data) gets processed at our main offices and wherever else the folks involved in processing it are located. This means your data might get sent to – and stored on – computers outside your state, province, or country. Just a heads-up: the data protection laws in those places might be different from where you are.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and then submitting your info, you're basically giving us the green light for that transfer. 👍

We're gonna take all the reasonable steps to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're confident there are solid controls in place, especially when it comes to keeping your data and other personal info safe and sound.

### Deleting Your Personal Data

You've got the right to delete your Personal Data that we've collected, or you can ask us to help you get rid of it.

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right from inside the Service itself.

You can always update, change, or delete your info by logging into your Account (if you have one) and heading to the account settings where you can manage your personal details. Or, just hit us up directly to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up though: we might need to hold onto some info if we have a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions

If the Company gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll definitely give you a heads-up before your data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement

Sometimes, we might have to spill the beans on your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) make a valid request. It's not ideal, but we gotta comply.

#### Other Legal Requirements

We might also disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:

- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data

Keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us, but let's be real: no internet transmission or electronic storage method is ever 100% foolproof. We do our best, using commercially acceptable ways to protect your data, but we can't promise it's absolutely, totally secure. Just something to keep in mind! 🔒

## Children's Privacy

Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. Period. We don't knowingly collect personal info from kids under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and you realize your child has given us Personal Data, please get in touch! If we ever find out we've collected data from someone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll quickly remove that info from our servers. Kids' privacy is serious business! 🧒👧

If we need your consent to process your info, and your country says a parent has to give that consent, then we might ask for your parent's go-ahead before we collect and use that data.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't run. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to their site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of *every* site you visit. Better safe than sorry! 🌐

Just so you know, we don't have any control over – and can't take responsibility for – the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. It's on them!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. When we do, we'll let you know by posting the shiny new version right here on this page.

Before any changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a clear notice on our Service. We'll also update that 'Last Updated' date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to check this Privacy Policy regularly for any updates. Any changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted here.
