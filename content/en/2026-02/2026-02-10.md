## **🔥 Top 10 Must-Reads**

### 1. [OpenHealth: Open-Source AI Health Assistant with 3,800+ Stars](https://github.com/OpenHealthForAll/open-health)

Ever thought about feeding your health data to AI and letting it analyze you? That's what OpenHealth does. This open-source project has already racked up 3,800+ stars, and its core pitch is "your data, your rules"—all health info stays local, AI analysis runs entirely on your own data. For people worried about privacy leaks but still wanting AI-powered health management, this might be the most legit option out there right now. Developers can fork it and start playing.

---

### 2. [SparkyFitness: AI Health Tracking Tool Built for Families](https://github.com/CodeWithCJ/SparkyFitness)

How hard is it to get the whole family on a diet together? This 2,200+ star project wants to solve that. SparkyFitness bundles food, exercise, water intake, and health metrics all in one place, with family members tracking together. The killer feature? "Family collaboration"—mom's blood pressure, the kids' workout logs, your calorie count, all in one app. Perfect for families wanting to digitize their health management. Open source, totally free.

---

### 3. [New IBD Drug Target Discovery Framework: Machine Learning + Million-Scale Single-Cell Atlas](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.06.699999v1?rss=1)

Drug R&D for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been stuck on "can't find good targets." This preprint drops a heavy move: build a human gut atlas from 1 million single cells, then use a machine learning framework (called IPR) to dig out 85 disease-linked transcriptional programs and 400 cell-type-specific targets. Even cooler—they validated two candidate targets (PTGIR and IL6ST) in vitro, with mechanisms totally different from existing biologics. AI pharma folks should definitely dig into this methodology.

---

### 4. [Virtual Cells Reality Check: Stacking Data Alone Won't Work—You Need "Context"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.04.703804v1?rss=1)

"Virtual cells" is the ultimate dream of AI biology—computational models that predict how cells respond to any perturbation. But this position paper rains on the parade: just cranking up model parameters and data volume isn't enough. The real bottleneck? "Insufficient diversity in biological context." The authors prove it with a 22-million-cell immunology dataset: simple models perform just as well as complex ones within the same context, but when you try cross-context generalization, everything tanks. Bottom line: stop obsessing over scaling—causal reasoning and context diversity are what actually matter.

---

### 5. [DANST: Adversarial Neural Networks for Spatial Transcriptomics Cell Deconvolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-026-09659-y)

Spatial transcriptomics has a classic headache: one "spot" contains multiple cell types mixed together—how do you untangle them? DANST uses deep domain-adversarial neural networks to crack this problem, splitting mixed signals into single-cell-type expression profiles. For researchers studying tumor microenvironments or tissue development, this tool could become the new standard.

---

### 6. [DeepPurpose: Deep Learning Toolkit for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose)

Want to predict whether a small molecule will bind to a specific protein? DeepPurpose is a 1,100+ star open-source toolkit covering drug-target interactions (DTI), drug property prediction, protein function prediction, and more. Code works out of the box—perfect for AI pharma researchers and developers to hit the ground running.

---

### 7. [HealthChain: The "Middleware" Healthcare AI Has Been Missing](https://github.com/dotimplement/HealthChain)

What's the biggest headache in deploying healthcare AI? Messy data formats, systems that don't talk to each other, compliance nightmares. HealthChain calls itself "the missing middleware layer for healthcare AI," helping you wire together medical data, AI models, and clinical systems. Star count is still low (178), but the pain point is so real it's worth watching.

---

### 8. [Lotti: Local-First AI Health Assistant—Your Data Stays in Your Hands](https://github.com/matthiasn/lotti)

Another "privacy-first" AI health tool. Lotti's thing: all data lives on your local device, and you pick which AI provider to use (or run completely offline). Supports task tracking, smart summaries, health records, and more. 1,000+ stars—ideal for people who are paranoid about data privacy.

---

### 9. [DEPower: Power Analysis Tool for RNA-seq Experiment Design](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.05.704084v1?rss=1)

Before you run an RNA-seq experiment, do you know how many samples you need to detect significant differences? DEPower is a power analysis tool built on the DESeq2 framework, supporting both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq, plus an [online web version](https://poweranalysis-fb.streamlit.app/). Essential for experiment planning—could save you serious cash on wasted samples.

---

### 10. [New Framework for Drug Synergy Detection: Ditching the Voodoo of Bliss/Loewe Scoring](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.05.704019v1?rss=1)

In drug combination screening, Bliss, Loewe, and ZIP synergy scores have been used for decades, but they lack statistical inference, give unstable results, and sometimes just don't compute. This preprint proposes a nonparametric framework using isotonic regression to fit dose-response surfaces, then wild bootstrap for p-values. On the DrugCombDB dataset, repeat-experiment consistency (correlation 0.91) crushes traditional methods (0.53-0.74). If you're doing drug combination research, this is worth a serious read.
