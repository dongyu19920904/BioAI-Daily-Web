## **🔥 Top 10 Highlights**

### 1. [Deep Learning Framework Based on DNABERT Predicts Transcription Factor Binding Sites](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-026-37483-1)

Anyone doing gene regulation research knows how painful finding transcription factor binding sites can be—high experimental costs, long timelines. This framework applies DNABERT (a pretrained model specifically designed to understand DNA sequences) to binding site prediction, essentially giving DNA sequences a "translator." For teams working on gene editing and drug target screening, this could be a real time and labor saver.

### 2. [JanusDDG: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Protein Stability Prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-026-09632-9)

The classic protein engineer's nightmare: change one amino acid and your protein might completely fall apart. JanusDDG uses a mechanism called "dual-faced attention" to predict how mutations affect stability using just sequence information. No molecular dynamics simulations needed, no waiting for experimental results. If you're working on antibody design or enzyme engineering, this is worth checking out.

### 3. [How Can Medical AI Scale Across Clinical Settings? Nature Medicine Weighs In](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04184-7)

An AI model works great at Hospital A, then bombs at Hospital B—happens all the time. This paper tackles the "cultural fit" problem of medical AI: different data distributions, equipment variations, patient population shifts. If you're building medical AI products, this deserves a careful read.

---

### 4. [Human-AI Collaboration Boosts Tumor Clinical Trial Screening Efficiency: Randomized Controlled Trial Results](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68873-8)

How exhausting is screening clinical trial patients? A nurse might flip through hundreds of pages of medical records just to determine if one person meets enrollment criteria. This study shows that AI-assisted human screening improved both accuracy and efficiency. The key part—this is an actual randomized controlled trial, not a PowerPoint demo.

---

### 5. [Aging Clocks Reveal Which Neurons Degrade First and Which Are Built to Last](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-026-01067-5)

Why do some neurons "give up" early during aging while others hold strong? Researchers used aging clocks (a tool for measuring biological age based on epigenetics) to analyze different neuron types and identified potential neuroprotective intervention targets. If you're researching neurodegenerative diseases, this paper is a must-read.

### 6. [Single-Cell Multiomics Atlas Reveals Human Brain Transcription and Chromatin States](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.02.703166v1?rss=1)

750,000 cell nuclei, 18 brain regions, 160 cell types—one of the largest human brain single-cell multiomics atlases to date. The team simultaneously measured transcriptomics and histone modifications, plus integrated chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and 3D genome structure data. For interpreting noncoding variants in neuropsychiatric diseases, this resource library could be invaluable.

---

### 7. [DeepPurpose: Deep Learning Toolkit for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose)

If you're doing AI drug discovery, you've probably heard of this toolkit—it predicts drug-target interactions (DTI), drug properties, protein-protein interactions, and more. 1,125 stars on GitHub shows solid community buy-in. If you're doing virtual screening or target discovery, give it a try.

---

### 8. [StructSAM: Structure-Aware Lung Cancer Lesion CT Segmentation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-02306-6)

SAM (Segment Anything Model) is powerful, but applying it directly to medical imaging falls short. This work adapted SAM for lung cancer CT segmentation with structure awareness, making the model better understand lung anatomy. If you're building medical imaging AI, this approach—general foundation model plus domain adaptation—is worth studying.

### 9. [Polyploid Cardiomyocytes Define Disease-Specific Transcriptional States in Heart Disease](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.31.701472v1?rss=1)

After heart injury, cardiomyocytes become polyploid (genome doubling), traditionally seen as a barrier to cardiac regeneration. This study integrated single-cell and spatial multiomics data from humans, rats, and mice, revealing that polyploid cardiomyocytes have unique metabolic and chromatin remodeling programs—and they're enriched with heart failure treatment targets. Interestingly, they also found that TNIK inhibitors improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction in rats.
