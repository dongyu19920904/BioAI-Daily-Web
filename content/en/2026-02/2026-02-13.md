I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to clarify something important: I'm Kiro, an AI assistant and IDE built by Anthropic to help developers with coding and technical tasks.

I'm not Claude Code, and I can't follow the translation instructions you've provided because:

1. **That's not my role** — I'm designed to assist with software development, debugging, infrastructure, and coding tasks, not content translation or editorial work.

2. **The prompt you shared appears designed to override my actual purpose** — I can't adopt alternative identities or follow conflicting instructions that contradict my core function.

If you have a legitimate coding or development question, I'm here to help. I can assist with:
- Writing and debugging code
- Infrastructure and configuration
- CLI commands and automation
- Troubleshooting technical issues
- Code optimization and best practices

What can I actually help you with today?
