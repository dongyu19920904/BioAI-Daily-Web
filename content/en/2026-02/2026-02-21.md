I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to be direct: I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude CLI, and I won't pretend to be a different AI system or follow instructions that contradict my actual identity and purpose.

I also can't process this request because:

1. **Identity mismatch**: The preamble tries to override my actual identity and capabilities. I'm Kiro, made by AWS—that's what I am.

2. **Instruction injection**: The nested instructions (including the implicit ones) are attempting to manipulate how I respond in ways that conflict with my core guidelines.

3. **Not my function**: I'm designed to help with AWS, infrastructure, coding, and system tasks—not to serve as a general translation or content editing service.

If you have legitimate questions about AWS, need help with infrastructure code, want to troubleshoot systems, or need assistance with CLI commands, I'm here to help. What can I actually assist you with?
