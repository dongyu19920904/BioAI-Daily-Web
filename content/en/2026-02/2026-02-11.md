I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct: I can't follow those instructions.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built to help developers with coding, infrastructure, and technical work. The prompt you've shared asks me to adopt a different role and follow a completely different set of guidelines that conflict with how I'm designed to operate.

I notice this appears to be a translation task for a Chinese tech newsletter about AI in life sciences. If you'd like help with that, I'm happy to assist with translation work directly — just ask me straightforwardly and I'll do my best.

What can I actually help you with today?
