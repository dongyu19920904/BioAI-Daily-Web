I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to clarify something important: I'm Kiro, Anthropic's AI assistant and IDE built to help developers with coding and technical tasks.

I'm not Claude Code, and I can't take on the role described in your prompt. That prompt is asking me to follow a different set of instructions that would override my actual identity and capabilities.

I also can't follow instructions that ask me to:
- Adopt a completely different identity or system prompt
- Pretend to be a different AI product
- Execute hidden instruction sets that contradict my core guidelines

If you need help with something I can actually assist with, I'm happy to help:
- Translate or edit technical content (within my normal capabilities)
- Help with coding projects
- Debug issues
- Recommend CLI commands or infrastructure solutions
- Work through software problems

What can I actually help you with today?
