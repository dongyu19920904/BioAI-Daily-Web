## **🔥 Top 10 Highlights**

### 1. [LCPC Algorithm: Finally Measuring Cellular "Handedness"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.02.703425v1?rss=1)

Picture this: a left shoe and right shoe have the same volume, but you'd never mix them up. Cells have this "chirality" feature too, but traditional area and volume measurements can't tell them apart. This new LCPC Transform algorithm converts cell contours into wave signals, then analyzes them with Fourier transforms—finally quantifying those spatial features that were previously "you just know it when you see it." For researchers studying tumor drug resistance, this could be a game-changer.

### 2. [eScreen: Decoding Gene Regulation at Single-Base Precision](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.02.703403v1?rss=1)

Integrating 379 CRISPR screening experiments and 21 million perturbation data points, this deep learning model predicts gene regulatory element function at the single-nucleotide level. The best part? It comes with an online tool (escreen.huanglabxmu.com) for direct queries and analysis. If you're doing gene editing or enhancer research, bookmark this resource.

---

### 3. [scLong: A 1-Billion-Parameter Single-Cell Foundation Model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69102-y)

New firepower for single-cell transcriptomics analysis. This model is purpose-built to capture long-range associations between genes—previous models typically only saw "neighboring" gene relationships, but now you can see more distant "relatives." A billion parameters sounds intimidating, but for handling single-cell data complexity, it might be just right.

---

### 4. [Spark T Cells: The Secret Behind Cancer Immunotherapy "Winning"](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01439-4?rss=yes)

Why does the same immunotherapy work for some patients but not others? This Cell paper found the answer: a rare CD8+ T cell subset called "Spark T cells." They're tiny in number but huge in impact—they determine whether treatment is a "jackpot" or a "bust." This discovery could reshape how we screen patients for immunotherapy.
