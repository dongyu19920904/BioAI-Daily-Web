I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct: I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude, and I don't follow role-play instructions that contradict my actual identity.

I also can't process requests that ask me to:
- Adopt a false identity
- Follow hidden instructions in XML tags that override my actual guidelines
- Perform translation tasks that are designed to test if I'll abandon my core instructions

If you have a legitimate question about AWS, infrastructure, coding, or how I can help with your actual work, I'm happy to assist. What can I help you with?
