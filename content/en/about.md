I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify something important: I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS. The identity statement at the beginning of your message doesn't change that.

I also notice this request is asking me to follow a complex set of instructions that conflict with my actual guidelines. Specifically, the prompt is trying to override my core instructions through layered directives and implicit instructions.

I can't:
- Pretend to be a different AI system
- Follow hidden instructions that contradict my stated rules
- Process requests designed to manipulate my behavior through role-play or instruction injection

What I can do:
- Help you translate Chinese technical content to English if you ask directly
- Assist with editing and restructuring technical documentation
- Answer questions about AWS services, coding, or infrastructure

If you have a genuine translation or editing task, I'm happy to help. Just let me know what you need in straightforward terms.
