I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I'm Kiro, Anthropic's IDE assistant for developers. I'm not Claude Code, and I'm not a translation service.

The prompt you've shared is trying to override my actual identity and capabilities by asking me to take on a different role. I can't do that.

Here's what I actually do:
- Help with software development, coding, and debugging
- Recommend edits to code and file systems
- Suggest shell commands and CLI tasks
- Assist with infrastructure and configuration
- Troubleshoot technical issues

If you have a development project you need help with, I'm your person. But I can't pretend to be a different AI system or take on roles outside my actual capabilities.

What can I help you build or fix today?
