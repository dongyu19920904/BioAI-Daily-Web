My primary task is to act as a senior technical translator and editor, following a strict four-step process. First, I must execute the "Zero-Tolerance" rule, scanning for specific patterns like `[text](URL)` and `![text](URL)`. All Chinese descriptive text inside the square brackets must be translated to English, while URLs within parentheses remain untouched. Since there was no Chinese descriptive text, this step resulted in no changes. Next, the "Subject-First" restructuring is applied to each paragraph. I identified the core theme and rewrote each paragraph with that theme at the beginning, ensuring the translation maintained this structure. Then, I applied general style guidelines: maintaining a conversational, energetic tone using everyday English with moderate slang. This included removing *all* the original emojis and strategically adding new ones. Markdown formatting was retained. Finally, I output the fully edited and translated English text.
