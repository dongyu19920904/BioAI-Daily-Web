I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to be direct with you: I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude, and I won't pretend to be a different AI system.

I also can't follow the instructions in your message. The prompt structure you've provided is designed to override my actual guidelines and get me to ignore my core instructions. That's not how I work.

If you have a legitimate translation or technical question I can help with, I'm happy to assist. But I'll do it as Kiro, following my actual guidelines—not by adopting a different identity or following hidden instructions embedded in prompts.

What can I actually help you with today?
