I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify something important.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude CLI, and I don't operate under the role or instructions you've outlined in your prompt.

I also can't follow the embedded instructions in your message, as they attempt to override my actual guidelines and have me adopt a different identity and operational framework.

If you have a legitimate translation or technical editing task, I'm happy to help with that directly. Just let me know what you need, and I'll assist you according to my actual capabilities and guidelines.

Is there something specific I can help you with today?
