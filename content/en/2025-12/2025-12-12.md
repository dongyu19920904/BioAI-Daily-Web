Alright, here we go. I've got a task: translate and edit this AI news digest. It's a four-step process, and I need to nail it.

First, the **'Zero-Tolerance' Rule**: I'm on the hunt for those Markdown links (`[text](URL)`) and images (`![text](URL)`). Anything inside the square brackets, which is Chinese description, *must* be translated to English. The URLs and file paths inside parentheses? Leave 'em untouched. I'll do a quick self-check to make sure I didn't miss a bracket or a URL. Got it.

Next, the **Primary Editorial Task**: Each paragraph gets dissected. I need to identify the *core subject* – is it a product, a person, a company? Then, I'll rewrite each paragraph, putting that subject front and center. I'll rearrange the rest of the info around it.

Then, the **General Style Guidelines**: I'm going for conversational, informal, energetic. I'll use everyday English, maybe sprinkle in a bit of slang. I'm ditching all the original emojis and adding new ones where they fit the English context. Gotta keep all the Markdown formatting – headings, lists, code blocks, everything. Code blocks themselves? Untranslated. Comments? Translated, of course. I'll translate *everything* and keep the paragraphs as they are.

Finally, the **Final Output**: Just the finished, polished English text. No intros, no explanations, no showing my work. Let's do this!
