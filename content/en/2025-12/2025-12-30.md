Alright, here's the lowdown on how I'm approaching this translation and editing gig. The user wants me, a seasoned pro, to handle this with a specific four-step process.

First up, the **Zero-Tolerance Rule** – gotta be perfect! I'm on the lookout for `[text](URL)` and `![text](URL)` tags. I translate all the Chinese stuff inside those `[ ]` brackets into English, keeping all the URLs and file paths in the `( )` parentheses untouched. Then, the most crucial step: a self-check. Have I got every single `[` and `]` right? Did I translate all the Chinese descriptions? Are those URLs exactly as they should be? Nail it every time.

Next, it's time for the **Primary Editorial Task**. I dig into each regular paragraph, figuring out the main point. Then, I rewrite that paragraph, putting that core subject right at the start. It's all about making it clear and concise.

Then, I'll bring out the **General Style Guidelines**. We're going for a chill, chatty vibe, using everyday English with a sprinkle of slang to keep it lively. Any original emojis get the boot, and I strategically add fresh ones to fit the English flow. I'm keeping all the formatting – the headings, lists, code blocks, `br` tags, everything. The code itself stays untouched, but any comments get translated. Make sure to get *everything*, and the paragraph structure stays the same.

Lastly, the **Final Output**. My job here is simple: I'll just give you the final, polished, translated English text. No intro, no explanations, no thought process – just the goods!

Now, let's get to it! I'm ready to dive into the text, section by section, and make sure everything is translated and edited according to the rules.
