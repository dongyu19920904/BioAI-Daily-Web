Okay, here we go. As a Senior Technical Translator and Editor, I've got a four-step process to follow. First, the "Zero-Tolerance" rule: scan for links and images, translate any Chinese text *inside* those brackets, keep the URLs and file paths exactly as they are, and double-check my work. Next, the main editorial task: understand the core theme of each paragraph, put it at the beginning, and then reorganize the other info around it. Then, I apply the style guidelines: keep the tone conversational, use everyday English (with a little slang), remove the original emojis but add new ones if they fit the English context, and preserve the markdown formatting. Don't touch the code itself, just translate the comments. And finally, output only the final, edited, and translated text. No intros or explanations, got it. Let's get to work!

### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **arXiv** has rolled out HTML versions of papers. Since its experimental launch in 2023, the institution has been converting TeX into semantic web pages using [LaTeXML technology](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825) (AI News). These semantic tags make screen reading, zooming, and [browser translation extensions](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825) much easier, significantly boosting accessibility. While PDFs are still hard to replace, community projects like [ar5iv](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825) offer alternative rendering. Mathematical formulas use [MathML/SVG](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825) to ensure precise typesetting (AI News).

2.  **Doubao phone** has been banned by platforms. Manufactured by Nubia, this device could perform complex operations like playing 'Dou Dizhu' with just a single voice command. However, several of its features were urgently adjusted after it touched upon the [interests of major platforms like Douyin](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6934f060a7fda7e20bae6cf2) (AI News). Douyin has since issued an announcement proposing to jointly build industry standards and [safeguard the rights of all parties](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6934f060a7fda7e20bae6cf2). The second generation of the product is expected to launch in 2026 (AI News Daily).<br/>![AI News: Doubao Phone Feature Demo Interface Screenshot](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbwpxadzfphv36gpsxqnxn33.avif)<br/>

### Cutting-Edge Research
