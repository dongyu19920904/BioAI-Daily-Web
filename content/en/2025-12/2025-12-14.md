### **Today's Summary**
```
Runway released the general world model GWM-1, supporting 3D space construction, virtual human generation, and robot training environments.
The supporting Gen-4.5 adds native audio generation and multi-camera consistency editing to achieve joint audio and video modeling.
Developers and creators rejoice: a new era of video generation, 3D world modeling revolutionizes content creation!

Google Translate integrates the Gemini model, with real-time voice translation in 70 languages and oral practice functions in 20 countries launched.
Understanding context and tone, the translation is more natural, and headphones instantly become simultaneous interpretation devices.
A must-have travel gadget, students have AI error correction for oral practice, and language barriers are swept away!

GPT-5.2 was poorly received, with SimpleBench scores lower than Claude and significant declines in emotional intelligence.
High benchmark scores cannot solve real-world dialogue scenarios, and overly strict safety rejection mechanisms are criticized as inhumane.
Reminds developers that evaluating AI can't just look at the benchmark, user experience is king!

### **Frontier Research**
1. **GPT-5.2 is getting slammed just 24 hours after release, and the benchmark scores are a disaster 😂**
   OpenAI's [GPT-5.2 (AI News)](https://ai.hubtoday.app//2025-12/2025-12-14/) SimpleBench score is actually lower than Claude Sonnet 3.7, and it can't even count the letter "r" in "garlic" 🤦‍♀️! Emotional intelligence has regressed, with a mechanical response to unloved children; the safety rejection mechanism is too strict and criticized as "inhumane." Netizens mocked it: high benchmark scores can't solve real-world dialogue scenarios 😩. It seems like you still need to look at the actual user experience and not just the scores!
   👨‍💻 **Developers**: This reminds us that we can't just look at the benchmark when evaluating AI! 📊 **Users**: Claude still feels better, it's emotionally intelligent!

   Oracle's bet on OpenAI, totaling around [300 Billion US Dollars (AI News)](https://ai.hubtoday.app//2025-12/2025-12-14/), is causing long-term enterprise contracts to expire, and customers are switching to PostgreSQL and OpenJDK to reduce costs. Banks are migrating in phases through Amazon RDS, and some vendors have announced the end of Oracle support. Credit default swaps are rising, and the market is worried about excessive AI investment 📉. Is this all-in or a vision of the future? Time will tell!
   💼 **Enterprises**: Oracle customers should consider migration plans! 📈 **Investors**: AI bubble or new opportunity? Observe with caution!

2. **AI's Impact on White-Collar Jobs May Exceed Expectations, Policymakers are still asleep 😬**

Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Gemini 3.0 integrate business processes, and white-collar jobs may be reduced by 30%-70% in the next 10 years. The political arena has yet to formulate a response, and the problem cannot be solved by "skill upgrades" alone. This wave of impact is coming faster than expected!
   👔 **White-collar Workers**: It's time to think about transitioning before you're passively eliminated! 🏛️ **Policymakers**: Wake up! Our social safety nets need a redesign!

   Ethan Mollick recently shared a classic riddle on [Twitter (AI News)](https://x.com/emollick/status/1999960137386361093): "A boy was taken to the emergency room after a car accident, and the surgeon said, 'I can't operate on this boy!' Why?" o3-pro and Gemini 2.5 still couldn't answer correctly. The answer is actually simple: the surgeon is the boy's mom 😂! AI's gender bias still exists!
