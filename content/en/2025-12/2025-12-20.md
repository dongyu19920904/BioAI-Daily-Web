## Aivora AI Daily 2025/12/20
> AI Daily
### **Today's Digest**
ByteDance is making waves! They're boosting salaries by 35% to snatch talent, and TikTok has locked down its US plan: keeping core operations while only handing over data oversight. On top of that, ByteDance is teaming up with phone manufacturers to embed AI deep into system layers. Meanwhile, open-source projects are seeing a surge in mining Trojans – remember to check your code before deployment! Apple's "tax" continues to double-dip in China, and Alibaba got trolled by an AI-generated fake image. Today, we're focusing on how ByteDance is "hatching eggs with borrowed chickens."

## **Today's AI News**
### **👀 Just One Sentence**
ByteDance is pulling off some seriously slick moves tonight! They're showering employees with insane raises and bonuses, all while deftly handling the TikTok crisis in the US, *and* planning to embed AI directly into your phone's operating system. Talk about multi-tasking! 🤯

### **🔑 3 Key Takeaways**

---
## **🔥 Must-Read TOP 10 (In-Depth Visuals)**
### **1. [ByteDance: I Want to Keep a Low Profile, But My Strength Won't Allow It](https://readhub.cn/topic/8pDEnmgvUxZ)**
**💸 Making Bank:** While other tech giants are busy with layoffs and cost-cutting, ByteDance just dropped a little "capital shockwave" on the entire industry.
**What's Up:** ByteDance's internal email laid it all out: **"In 2025, we're going all out to recruit and retain talent."** The bonus pool is skyrocketing by 35%, and the salary adjustment budget has been boosted by 1.5 times! They explicitly stated that both the upper and lower limits of compensation packages will be raised, aiming to be "not just leading, but far, far ahead."
**Our Take:** This isn't just an email; it's a battle cry for headhunters! Folks in the AI scene, time to dust off those resumes! 🚀

### **2. [TikTok US Grand Finale? Keep the Money, Hand Over the Data](https://readhub.cn/topic/8pChmLys9YG)**
**🇺🇸 Breaking News:** The Sword of Damocles hanging over TikTok's head might finally be dropping. What's the deal?
Shou Zi Chew sent an internal memo outlining a rather clever (in a good way!) plan: A joint venture will be established specifically for data security to satisfy US regulatory demands. But here's the kicker: **e-commerce and advertising, the two money-printing machines, will remain firmly in ByteDance's hands.** The goal is to finalize this by January 2026.
**Our Take:** This plan is probably the most dignified "no-divorce" solution imaginable right now. As long as the core algorithms and monetization stay intact, it's still the TikTok we know and love. 😉

### **3. [Are Phone Manufacturers Panicking? ByteDance AI is About to "Parasitize"](https://readhub.cn/topic/8pCw80Lx599)**
**📱 The Play:** Thought ByteDance only did apps? Nah, they're aiming to move right into your phone's operating system now.
ByteDance is secretly cooking up something big with **vivo, Lenovo, and Transsion**, planning to pre-install their AIGC plugins directly onto phones. Basically, they're bypassing App Store restrictions to grab the AI entry point at the system level.
**Our Take:** This move is what we call "hatching eggs with borrowed chickens." For phone manufacturers, it means a new AI selling point. For ByteDance, it's the shortest path straight to users' fingertips. 🐔🥚

### **4. ["Kill Doubao"? Alibaba: Not My Fault, It's AI's Doing](https://readhub.cn/topic/8pDEorDsJBl)**
**🍉 Spill the Tea:** A photo from an "Alibaba Qianwen All-Hands Meeting" went viral today, with a slogan that shockingly read "Kill Doubao"! How wild is that?!
The result? A huge misunderstanding. Insiders at Alibaba quickly dismissed it as "obviously fake." Later, someone dug up the truth: **this image was actually generated using a competitor's (reportedly Doubao's) AI painting tool!** 🤣
**Our Take:** LOL, using your rival's AI to generate a slogan attacking them, only to get busted? This isn't just corporate warfare; it's a public masterclass in AI-generated image detection! 🕵️‍♀️

### **5. [Apple Tax Drops in Japan, Is China the "Sucker"?](https://readhub.cn/topic/8pC6KTQpShS)**
**🍎 Controversy:** Buying an iPhone is one thing, but thanks to varying App Store commissions, we might just be playing the role of "the world's richest suckers."
Apple, under legal pressure, caved in Japan, opening up to third-party stores and payments. However, among the world's top four markets, **China remains a solid block of dual monopoly**, boasting the highest commission rates globally. 😤
**Our Take:** Tim Cook might *say* he loves the Chinese market, but his actions (and the "highest tax rate") speak volumes. Consumers grumbling won't cut it; we'll have to see if a mandatory regulatory hammer drops later. 🔨

### **6. [Pinduoduo Changes Leadership: Temu is the Favorite Child](https://readhub.cn/topic/8pDIEJHN2lV)**
**🛍️ Shake-up:** Pinduoduo's famous "slash and save" tactic is about to get an upgrade.
Zhao Jiazhen has been appointed Co-Chairman. The signal here is crystal clear: **they're going all-in on the supply chain.** Pinduoduo plans to pour money into overhauling its supply chain over the next three years, aiming to essentially recreate another Pinduoduo (Temu).
**Our Take:** Don't just focus on the domestic "billion-dollar subsidies" anymore. The current script is "Chinese factories + Pinduoduo algorithms" taking on the global market. Get ready! 🌍

### **7. [Server Mined? The Dark Pit of Open Source Projects](https://linux.do/t/topic/1343806)**
**⚠️ Pitfall Alert:** A fellow developer wanted to set up an AI story generation project (Narratium), but their server instantly turned into someone else's mining rig!
The mining Trojan latched on like superglue right after deployment, impossible to remove, keeping the CPU at 100% load indefinitely. This usually happens when using a dodgy Docker image or if malicious code is hidden in scripts.
**Our Take:** Playing with open-source AI projects? **Seriously, don't run naked in an era full of pitfalls like this!** Check your scripts, use non-root permissions, and keep that firewall locked down. Otherwise, you're just paying the hackers' electricity bills. 💸

### **8. [Luo Yonghao Slams Telecom: Gigabit Becomes Megabit, Relies on "Going Crazy" for Rights](https://readhub.cn/topic/8pBlJTXoGzV)**
**🤬 Rant Alert:** Even Luo Yonghao couldn't take it anymore, taking to his WeChat Moments to complain about Shanghai Telecom.
Luo Yonghao signed up for exclusive gigabit broadband, but the actual speed was less than a tenth of that! After days of calling customer service for repairs, it broke again. Luo Yonghao declared that if it wasn't fixed, he'd "go crazy online."
**Our Take:** This situation is wild: even a celebrity has to threaten to "go crazy" to defend their rights! For regular folks encountering such "falsely advertised" broadband, it's probably just a case of gritting your teeth and restarting the router. 🤷‍♀️

### **9. [Google One Verification Loop: Even Strong AI Fears Bugs](https://linux.do/t/topic/1343826)**
**🐛 Glitch Alert:** Google's AI models are pretty powerful, but their user system feels like a joke.
A netizen tried to snag some Google One perks (or just use it normally), but got stuck in an infinite "verify eligibility" loop. Click verify -> nothing happens -> click again -> still nothing. 😩
**Our Take:** This is a classic case of "big tech arrogance." Algorithms can calculate the universe, but they can't fix a simple webpage redirection bug. Seriously?

### **10. [Deep Thinking Mode vs. Pro Version: IQ Tax or Real Skill?](https://linux.do/t/topic/1343820)**
**🧠 Deep Dive:** Current AI models are so numerous they'll make your head spin. So, which one should you actually use?
The community is buzzing, discussing the differences between Claude/GPT's Thinking Mode (long thought) and their Pro versions.
**Here's the Lowdown (from experience):** If you're architecting code or tackling complex logical deductions, you absolutely *must* enable "long thinking" mode – it can fix tons of logical flaws. But if you're just polishing an email or doing simple Q&A, the Pro version is plenty. Don't waste those pricey "thinking credits"! 💡
