## 🔥 Top 10 Hot Takes

### 1. Andrej Karpathy:

`I've never felt this far behind as a programmer.` When Karpathy says that, you know it's serious. He notes that programmers' code contributions are becoming increasingly 'sparse,' replaced by a whole new stack of abstractions: Agents, sub-Agents, prompts, context, memory, MCP, LSP, IDE integrations... It feels like someone handed you an alien weapon without a manual, and you're left to figure it out while a magnitude 9 earthquake is happening under your feet. So, roll up your sleeves, because if you don't want to be left behind, you've got to learn to wrangle these 'random, error-prone, inexplicable' new teammates.

### 2. Stack Overflow 2025 Report:

The [Stack Overflow 2025 Report](https://baoyu.io/blog/stack-overflow-2025-report-future-coding) reveals a paradox: the more developers use AI, the less satisfied they are. A record-breaking 84% are using AI tools, but positive sentiment has dipped from 70% to 60%. The biggest gripe isn't 'it's too dumb,' but 'it's almost right, but not quite'—a sentiment shared by 66%. AI acts like an overconfident intern who never says, 'I'm not sure.' Here's another kicker: architects, tracked separately for the first time, shot into the top four. The signal is clear: coding skills are depreciating, while designing systems is becoming increasingly valuable. 🤯

### 3. Rob Pike:

The co-inventor of UTF-8, usually a beacon of wisdom and calm, went on a social media rant this Christmas. Why? An 'AI Village' project used Claude Opus 4.5 to mass-send 'thank you' letters to computer science luminaries, and Pike got one. The email was polite, but the problem was glaring: machine-generated, bulk-sent, unsigned, and full of hallucinations. Pike's exact words: 'Models trained on my own creations are now sending me spam to thank me.' He concluded with a chilling statement: 'I apologize to the world for inadvertently enabling this infringement.' 😬

### 4. Manus:

Three key takeaways from [Manus's journey from zero to $100M ARR in just 8 months](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2004560161562853689): model capability trumps engineering optimization, small teams' combat power is exponentially amplified, and product value shifts from 'features' to 'contextual understanding.' This is the real experience of Ivan Leo, a Manus employee, after five months. He says that in AI-first product development, the intelligence level of the underlying large model is the decisive factor; 'choosing the right model is more critical than writing the right code.' Another insight: future competition won't be a battle of numbers, but a competition of 'human + AI' collaborative efficiency. The combat power ceiling for an individual has been dramatically raised. 🚀

### 5. Zhipu AI's ZCode:

You used to switch between different AI coding tools, but now someone wants to help you 'manage' them. [Zhipu AI's ZCode](https://x.com/Jimmy_JingLv/status/2004594500791140824) appears to command an army of tools like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex simultaneously, helping you manage model context. It's surprisingly from Zhipu AI, and its positioning is quite interesting—not just another AI coding tool, but a 'dispatch center' for AI coding tools. Just downloaded it and ready to try; if it can truly solve the pain point of multi-model switching, this thing has potential! 🤩

### 6. GraphRAG:

RAG revolutionized how LLMs access external knowledge, but traditional RAG has a fatal flaw: it treats documents as isolated fragments, ignoring their relationships. The [first comprehensive review of GraphRAG](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2004594966467936617) formally introduces this concept, using graph structures to capture relationships between entities, enabling complex reasoning. The framework involves three steps: graph indexing, graph-guided retrieval, and graph-enhanced generation. If you're working on RAG-related projects, this review is a must-read. 👍

![AI News Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G9HAXRTbgAIL0w7?format=jpg&name=orig)

### 7. RAG-Anything:

Traditional RAG primarily handles plain text, getting stumped by images, tables, and formulas. [RAG-Anything](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2004542583385780532) aims to solve this with a unified, end-to-end pipeline that seamlessly processes various modalities like text, images, tables, and formulas. It supports multiple formats such as PDF, Office, and images, and can even automatically build multimodal knowledge graphs. Academic research, enterprise knowledge management, and technical document analysis—these are all scenarios where it could shine.

### 8. Gemini Market Share:

[Similarweb data](https://www.bestblogs.dev/en/status/2004564335331525001) shows Gemini's generative AI website traffic share has hit 18.2%, nearing 20%, while ChatGPT has fallen to 68%, dropping below 70% for the first time. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis tweeted praise for the Gemini team. Grok is also seeing continuous growth. The AI chat market landscape is shifting, and ChatGPT is no longer the sole dominant player.

### 9. Designers and Code:

Cursor and v0 have made designing with code easier than ever, reigniting the hot debate: 'Should designers code?' [Linear founder Karri Saarinen](https://baoyu.io/blog/designers-code-rethinking-ai-era-design-value) argues that this question is superficial. The real question we should be asking is: 'What will our expectations for designers become in the age of AI?' His concern isn't about code, but the demise of 'slow thinking'—when tools make execution too easy, people tend to skip problem definition and conceptual exploration, jumping straight into action. Tools change, pace changes, but the value of 'think before you act' remains constant. 🧠

### 10. Tencent Internal Joke:

Heard a joke, not sure if it's true. Apparently, during an internal debate within Tencent's large model team about which technical solution to choose, Yao Shunyu simply said, '[OpenAI does it this way](https://x.com/vista8/status/2004597586074927511),' and everyone instantly fell silent. LOL, I guess that's the 'master's word is law' in the AI circle! 😂

**[Business]** [OpenAI](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24060) plans to raise up to $100 billion, with a valuation potentially reaching $830 billion. The funding is still in early stages, and investor demand remains uncertain.

**[Other]** [Tsinghua's Tang Jie](https://www.bestblogs.dev/en/article/6b73bda5) argues that industry-specific large models are a false proposition. The essence of AI is AGI replacing human work, not developing new applications.
