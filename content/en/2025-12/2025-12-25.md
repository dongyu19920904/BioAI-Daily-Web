## **🔥 Top 10 Heavy Hitters**

### 1. [Claude Pro/Max Christmas Limited-Time Usage Doubled](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/2003923042100273389)

Claude users, are you still tearing your hair out over usage limits? Well, good news! Anthropic's Alex Albert just announced that from midnight tonight until the New Year, Pro and Max plan usage is directly *doubled*. This move is straightforward and blunt – no fancy tricks, just letting you go wild. So, seize the holiday opportunity and get those long-awaited big projects running!

### 2. [Google AI Pro Annual Fee 50% Off, This Deal is a Must-Grab](https://x.com/op7418/status/2003846590780538969)

Google seems to be in a hurry with this one! New users get a direct 50% off on the annual Pro plan, which includes Gemini 3 Pro, Deep Research, and 2TB of cloud storage. This works out to just a few bucks a month, even cheaper than buying cloud storage separately. The only catch is that renewals revert to the original price, but hey, grab a year first, and we'll worry about next year's problems next year!

### 3. [Notion CEO's Long Read: AI is the "Steel" of Organizations](https://baoyu.io/blog/steam-steel-and-infinite-brains)

Notion CEO Ivan Zhao's article is a must-read for every manager, seriously, read it three times! Using historical metaphors of steel and steam engines, Ivan Zhao thoroughly explains AI's impact on organizations. He argues we're still in the "replacing water wheels" phase, just shoehorning chatbots into old processes. True transformation, however, means redesigning the organization itself. Inside Notion, over 700 agents are already handling repetitive tasks. His co-founder, Simon, now simultaneously directs three or four AI programming agents, transforming from a "10x engineer" into a "30-40x engineer."

### 4. [MiniMax M2.1 Open-Sourced: Multilingual Programming Directly Crushes Claude 4.5](https://www.minimax.io/news/minimax-m21)

MiniMax M2.1 is making waves, and open-source models are finally getting their moment in the programming arena! M2.1's performance in languages like Rust, Java, Go, and C++ surpasses both Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 4.5 Sonnet. With 10 billion active parameters, its code repair accuracy in real-world engineering tasks absolutely crushes closed-source models. Open-source enthusiasts are ecstatic – no more API fee headaches!

### 5. [Alibaba Tongyi Open-Sources Voice Interaction Large Model Fun-Audio-Chat-8B](https://funaudiollm.github.io/funaudiollm/)

Alibaba's Fun-Audio-Chat-8B is finally here, a voice model that can "understand emotions"! This isn't just speech-to-text; it perceives your emotions from tone, pace, and pauses, then responds with empathy. It saves nearly 50% of GPU resources, boasts ultra-low latency, and even supports direct function calls via voice. Its performance is hot on the heels of GPT-4o Audio, but here's the kicker: it's open-source!

### 6. [Anthropic Open-Sources Agent Skills Knowledge Base](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)

Anthropic's Agent Skills knowledge base, essentially Claude's "skill tree," is finally open! This knowledge base includes 16 demonstration skills, covering areas like document processing, creative design, and development techniques. You can use them directly or build your own using the templates. The coolest part is the on-demand loading mechanism – unused skills don't consume tokens; they load only when needed. Claude Code users and paying subscribers can dive in right now.

### 7. [ByteDance Releases Seed Prover 1.5: Math Proof AI Wins IMO Silver Medal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17260)

ByteDance is serious about letting AI tackle math proofs this time! Seed Prover 1.5 uses Agentic reinforcement learning, flexibly calling upon the Mathlib mathematical library and Python code for verification. This bad boy achieved silver and gold medal standards in the IMO 2025 and Putnam Mathematical Competition. Formal mathematical reasoning, that tough nut to crack, is finally being gnawed at!

### 8. [Alibaba Open-Sources Qwen-Image-Edit-2511: New Benchmark for Open-Source Drawing Models](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511)

Alibaba's Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 is here, and open-source drawing models are finally getting serious! Character consistency, built-in LoRA, and Chinese writing capabilities – this update tackles the long-standing headache of inconsistent character features in multi-person photos. It also integrates various community-contributed LoRA effects. Industrial design and geometric reasoning capabilities have also improved, allowing for direct generation of auxiliary lines. The Flux Dev version? It's just a little sibling compared to this.

### 9. [GLM-4.7 Reportedly Open-Sourcing Soon: Domestic Programming Model Reaches Top](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7)

Zhipu AI is clearly holding back a big move with GLM-4.7! This model has claimed the top spot domestically and among open-source models on LiveCodeBench and Code Arena, with its comprehensive programming capabilities hot on the heels of Claude 4.5 Sonnet. Someone even used it to recreate Plants vs. Zombies, and it can generate a fruit-slicing game from a single prompt. Zhipu just submitted its prospectus to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, so open-sourcing now? The timing is absolutely brilliant!

### 10. [Baoyu's Interpretation: Two Paths for AI Agents to Get Stronger](https://baoyu.io/blog/ai-agent-stronger-skills-vs-subagent)

This article by Baoyu thoroughly explains Agent architecture, specifically focusing on Skills vs. SubAgent. The core difference lies in context management: Skills can easily clutter the "work desk," while SubAgents keep the main Agent's desktop clean. The article also provides three advanced tips: expand first then compress, use the file system as a transit point, and leverage the Rewind feature. A must-read for Agent developers!
