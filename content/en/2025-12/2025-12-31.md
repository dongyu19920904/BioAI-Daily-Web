## **🔥 Top 10 Hot Takes**

### 1. [Meta Acquires Manus for Billions, Founder Becomes VP](https://x.com/dotey/status/2006074924868440120)
Meta just dropped a bombshell: they're acquiring Chinese AI Agent company Manus for billions of dollars! This makes it Meta's third-largest acquisition ever, right after WhatsApp and Instagram. Manus founder Xiao Hong is set to become a Meta VP. Get this: Manus only launched in March and hit a whopping $125 million ARR in just a few months. Now, Zuckerberg has officially scooped them up. This move is a huge win for Chinese teams expanding their AI Agent game globally, setting a serious benchmark!

### 2. [Manus Founder Deep Dive: Doing a Thousand Small Things Right is Better Than Three Big Ones](https://x.com/dotey/status/2006065780253655070)
Manus founder Peak's podcast interview, compiled by Baoyu, is packed with insights. Peak's core philosophy? Manus is all about an "intelligence-driven" Agent approach, not a "rules-driven" one. This means no predefined workflows; the model figures out each step on its own. If there's no MCP, it reads API docs. No API? It simulates human actions using a browser. This "doing a thousand small things right" engineering philosophy might just be why Meta was so keen on them.

### 3. [Tencent Hunyuan Open-Sources HY-Motion 1.0: Billion-Parameter Text-to-3D Motion Model](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2006020321787134357)
Tencent just dropped a massive bomb: they've open-sourced HY-Motion 1.0! This billion-parameter text-to-3D motion model lets you describe actions in natural language and directly generates high-quality 3D character animations. Built on a Diffusion Transformer architecture, it covers over 200 action categories, and its output can plug right into existing 3D animation pipelines. Game developers and animators, you'll definitely want to check this out!

### 4. [Study Reveals: Pro Programmers Don't Vibe, They Control](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2006063755449504154)
A study of 99 seasoned developers (with 3-41 years of experience) just dropped a truth bomb: pro programmers use AI Agents totally differently from the "Vibe Coding" hype you see online. Every single developer in the study actively controls software design and implementation, and on average, half of the AI-generated code gets tweaked. They "tame" AI with detailed prompts, 70+ step planning files, and project rules. The takeaway is crystal clear: AI is a collaborator, not an autopilot.
