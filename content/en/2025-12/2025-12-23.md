## **Today's AI News**

### **👀 One-Liner**
San Francisco's massive blackout brought Waymo's self-driving cars to a standstill, blocking intersections. But Tesla's FSD, which doesn't need high-definition maps, calmly navigated through. Musk is absolutely winning big on this one.

## **🔥 Must-Reads: TOP 10 (In-depth with Images)**

### **1. [Flask Creator's Prophecy: Programming is Dead, Long Live Vibe Coding](https://x.com/dotey/status/2003176742857691603)**
**Armin Ronacher, the legendary creator of the Flask framework, just dropped what might be the most gut-punching article of the year.** After two decades of coding, Ronacher admits that in 2025, he no longer codes the way he used to. Gone are the days of typing every line himself; now, he's more of a "tech lead for virtual interns."
**Ronacher introduces a new term: "Vibe Coding."** It's all about letting go of syntax nitpicks and best practices, instead relying on intuition to determine if AI-generated code "feels" right. This mystical coding method renders traditional engineering experience obsolete, yet it also frees us from tedious implementation. If you're still obsessing over syntax, you might just be left behind by the times.

### **2. [Yann LeCun Goes Off Late Night: "Your 'General Intelligence' Doesn't Exist"](https://x.com/ylecun/status/2003227393071439979)**
**Just when everyone's hyping up AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) as being just around the corner, Meta's Chief AI Scientist, Yann LeCun, is here to rain on the parade.** He dropped a lengthy post, slamming the idea, arguing that the human brain is highly "specialized," not general at all.
**LeCun illustrates his point:** theoretically, given enough time and paper, a human brain can be Turing-complete. But for practical tasks like playing chess or processing massive datasets, human efficiency is ridiculously low. He believes the current LLM trajectory is similar, and constantly fantasizing about "general" intelligence is a dead end. This guy really isn't holding back before he leaves!

### **3. [Waymo Paralyzed by Blackout, a Victory for Pure Vision?](https://ai.hubtoday.app//2025-12/2025-12-23/)**
**We used to think LiDAR + high-definition maps were the only safe bet, but reality just slapped us hard.** A sudden massive blackout in San Francisco knocked out all traffic lights. Waymo's self-driving cars, which rely on HD maps and infrastructure interaction, instantly turned "brain-dead," clueless on where to go, and effectively blocked roads.
**In stark contrast, Tesla's FSD, which "sees" the road like a human, navigated the chaos with surprising ease.** This incident starkly exposed the fragility of relying on pre-set maps. Fans of the vision-only approach can definitely pop the champagne tonight!

### **4. [OpenAI Drops a Sweet Treat: See What You Talked About with ChatGPT This Year](https://x.com/gdb/status/2003242320448352371)**
**The "NetEase Cloud Music annual playlist" for the AI era has arrived!** OpenAI President Greg Brockman announced the launch of "Your Year with ChatGPT." If you've enabled memory, it will analyze your year's chat history, revealing your interests, work habits, and even quirks you didn't know you had.
**This feature is currently rolling out in the US, UK, and other regions, so remember to update your app.** It's more than just a recap; it's a mirror, showing you whether you've leveled up or slacked off this year.

### **5. [Anthropic Quietly Open-Sources Its "Killer Move" Library for Agents](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)**
**Anthropic, the parent company behind Claude, is all about actions speaking louder than words, and they've just open-sourced a repository called `skills` on GitHub.**
**This isn't just any ordinary toolkit; it's Anthropic's official standard for agent skills.** If you're building intelligent agents and scratching your head over how to elegantly enable AI to use tools and operate computers, this library is your ultimate "kung fu manual." Its 25k stars speak volumes: a tech giant is now showing you exactly how to build agents.

### **6. [Are More GitHub Stars Always Better? This Report Slaps 80% of Developers in the Face](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2003180917528088758)**
**Stop blindly jumping on the LangChain or AutoGen bandwagon!** DAIR.AI just dropped a hardcore report analyzing over 1500 agent projects. The conclusion stings: GitHub star counts simply don't equate to usability.
**For example, MetaGPT boasts 59,000 stars but is rarely used in complex real-world projects.** Conversely, LangGraph, despite fewer stars, proves incredibly stable in deployment. The report also highlights that current frameworks are a disaster when it comes to "logical failures" and "infinite loops." Before picking your tools, you absolutely need to check out this pitfall avoidance guide.

### **7. [Zhipu GLM-4.7 Leaked? Code Capabilities Seemingly Greatly Enhanced](https://linux.do/t/topic/1351367)**
**Chinese domestic models have been cooking up something special these past few days.** Developers using the Zhipu API were surprised to find the model version had become GLM-4.7. Real-world tests show increased thinking time (which is a good sign, indicating better reasoning) and, when writing code, it no longer foolishly adds random emojis but can understand complex logical breakdowns.
**This "silent upgrade" usually means a formal release is imminent.** If you find Claude too pricey, this might be an affordable alternative worth keeping an eye on soon.

### **8. [Google Open-Sources A2UI: Will Front-End Devs Stop Writing UI Code?](https://ai.hubtoday.app//2025-12/2025-12-23/)**
**Front-end engineers might just lose sleep over this one.** Google has open-sourced the A2UI project, and its core logic is brutally effective: AI doesn't need to write HTML/CSS code. Instead, it directly generates a JSON description, which the front-end app then automatically renders into a native interface.
**This means an intelligent agent can directly "conjure up" an operational panel for you, completely bypassing the security risks of "AI writing buggy code."** Future apps might all be dynamically generated; whatever interface you need, AI will draw one up for you on the spot.

### **9. [LLMLingua-2: Microsoft Shows You How to Halve Your Prompt Costs](https://linux.do/t/topic/1351456)**
**This is a real money-saving hack, folks!** Many people's prompts are long and messy, and running an API call feels like your heart is bleeding. Microsoft's LLMLingua-2 is designed specifically for this: it can compress (distill) your long texts, cutting out the fluff and keeping only the essentials.
**Test data shows token usage can be reduced by nearly 50%, with almost no change in model comprehension accuracy.** For applications that need to feed a ton of documents to AI, this is an absolute lifesaver.

### **10. [Ant Group Unveils "Anzhen'er": A Hundred-Billion Parameter AI Doctor](https://ai.hubtoday.app//2025-12/2025-12-23/)**
**This isn't just some AI that Googles symptoms!** Ant Group has released a medical model with hundreds of billions of parameters, utilizing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Its standout feature is its "clinical-level diagnostic thinking," meaning it's not just regurgitating information but reasoning like a doctor.
**Currently, it's already deployed in cardiac health and psychological counseling scenarios.** In the medical field, where the margin for error is extremely low, this massive investment in a hundred-billion parameter model shows that major tech companies are genuinely committed to solving the problem of "difficulty accessing medical care," rather than just showing off.
