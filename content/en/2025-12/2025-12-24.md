## **🔥 Top 10 Major News**
### 1. [GPT-5.2 Surpasses Human Baseline on ARC-AGI-2, Scoring 75%](https://x.com/gdb/status/2003570781192957991)
GPT-5.2 just shattered expectations on ARC-AGI-2, hitting a whopping 75%! This model, GPT-5.2 X-High, directly surpassed the human baseline, which was previously a tough hurdle with best scores just over 60%. It scored 15 percentage points higher than the previous SOTA, with each problem costing less than $8. Greg Brockman personally retweeted it, showcasing OpenAI's strong capabilities at year-end.

### 2. [ChatGPT Annual Report Launched, Sam Altman Complains He Didn't Make Top 1%](https://x.com/sama/status/2003419371432214548)
ChatGPT's 'Your Year with ChatGPT' annual report is out, and it's got everyone talking, especially Sam Altman! OpenAI pushed this report to users, showing how much they chatted with ChatGPT and how many images they generated this year. Interestingly, some found that just 11,000 messages were enough to enter the global Top 1%, indicating that most people don't actually use it that deeply. The funniest part? Sam Altman himself tweeted, 'Didn't make Top 1%, a bit disappointed' — seriously, boss, are you too busy for your own creation?

### 3. [Replit Directly Embeds ChatGPT, Code Without Switching Tabs](https://x.com/gdb/status/2003535410383978728)
Replit just made coding with ChatGPT a breeze by directly embedding it, letting you code without switching tabs! Previously, when using ChatGPT to write code, you had to copy and paste it into an IDE to run. Now, with Replit directly integrated, you describe your requirements, and it helps you run the application immediately. No need to configure environments or switch windows, shortening the path from 'idea' to 'something runnable.' For those who quickly validate ideas, this combo is quite sweet.
### 4. [ERNIE-5.0 Ranks First Among Domestic Models on LMArena, 23 Points Higher Than Previous Version](https://x.com/op7418/status/2003394479697592740)
ERNIE-5.0-Preview-1203 just made a splash for Baidu, ranking first among domestic models on the LMArena text leaderboard! This is quite interesting. ERNIE-5.0-Preview-1203 surpassed Qwen, scoring 23 points higher than its previous version, mainly thanks to its creative writing and high-difficulty instruction capabilities. More importantly, Baidu is no longer holding back for big releases but is frequently issuing small version iterations, a strategic shift worth noting.

### 5. [MiniMax M2.1 and GLM-4.7 Released on the Same Day, Front-end Aesthetic Capabilities Are Explosive](https://x.com/op7418/status/2003505367909843292)
MiniMax M2.1 and GLM-4.7 dropped on the same day, and their front-end aesthetic capabilities are absolutely explosive! Letting AI help you build webpages used to result in ugly, unusable designs. But MiniMax M2.1's generated pages this time even changed the mouse cursor style, with full design flair. GLM-4.7 isn't bad either, with minor CSS Grid issues but overall strong performance. Domestic models have finally 'gotten it' when it comes to aesthetics, likely by specifically training on well-designed webpage data for RL.

### 6. [Tongyi Open-sources Fun-Audio-Chat 8B, Understands Your Emotions and Helps You Get Things Done](https://www.bestblogs.dev/article/865433ed)
Tongyi just open-sourced Fun-Audio-Chat 8B, a model that not only understands your emotions but can also help you get things done! This is no ordinary voice chat model. It can perceive emotions from your tone and speaking speed — if you're angry, it'll comfort you; if you're anxious, it'll guide you through deep breaths. Even more impressive, it supports Speech Function Call. You just say, 'Check my schedule for tomorrow,' and it directly calls the function to do it for you. It features an end-to-end architecture, low latency, and the 8B model is already open source.
### 7. [Gemini 3 Flash So Fast It Can Play Pictionary](https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/2003550229724037402)
Gemini 3 Flash is so incredibly fast, it can literally play Pictionary! Google showed off its speed: you're still drawing, and it has already guessed it. This real-time response capability is a must-have for scenarios requiring immediate feedback (e.g., real-time translation, game NPCs). Achieving this level of speed optimization indicates that Google has put serious effort into inference efficiency.

### 8. [Zhihu's Annual AI Product List Released: Doubao Ranks First, Cursor Ushers in the Year of Agents](https://x.com/op7418/status/2003387833701011939)
Zhihu's Annual AI Product List is out, and it's quite valuable for reference, especially highlighting Cursor as ushering in the year of Agents! Domestically, Doubao took first place with its low-threshold voice mode, and DeepSeek benefited from its early-year surge. Overseas, Gemini surged ahead with its year-end release, while Claude remains unshakable in the programming domain. But the most noteworthy is Cursor — it essentially defined this year's interaction paradigm for Agents; context engineering and multi-model hybrid calling are all trends it initiated.

### 9. [Baoyu's Deep Dive: Is AI a Bubble or Tomorrow? The Answer is Both](https://x.com/dotey/status/2003382215720235414)
Baoyu's deep dive asks: Is AI a bubble or tomorrow? His answer: it's both! In the past three years, AI companies' market value has increased by $10 trillion, and OpenAI's valuation growth is higher than the GDP of most countries. A bubble? In the short term, definitely. But history tells us that when the internet bubble burst, fiber optics remained; when the biotech craze passed, new drugs remained. Bubbles burst, but infrastructure doesn't disappear. For ordinary people, don't worry about valuations; using AI first is the real deal.

### 10. [LLMs Still Struggle with Web API Calls, But a Solution Has Been Found](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2003570764868649154)
LLMs still struggle with Web API calls, but guess what? Someone found a solution! Everyone thought code models calling APIs should be very stable, but actual tests show that no open-source model can solve more than 40% of tasks, with URL hallucination rates as high as 14-39%. The reason is that Web APIs differ too much from ordinary function calls — HTTP methods, long URLs, nested parameter types, models simply can't remember them. The good news is that researchers have proposed a constrained decoding scheme, converting OpenAPI specifications into regular expression constraints, directly boosting accuracy by 90%.
