Alright, I've got the instructions. It looks like I need to transform this text from Chinese to English, while also making it sound more lively and engaging. First, I'll be meticulously checking for anything that needs translating, specifically text inside brackets, `[text](URL)` and `![text](URL)` style stuff. I'll translate the bracketed text, but keep the URLs exactly as they are. Then, I'll read through the text section by section, figuring out the key idea of each paragraph, and rewriting it to put that key idea at the beginning. Finally, I'll add a bit of spice, using casual language, some slang, and strategically throwing in emojis where they fit. I have to keep all the original formatting, like headings and lists, and translate everything, keeping the paragraph structure intact. No intros, no explanations, just the final, polished output. Let's do this!

**7. New Direction in Agent Development: From Tool Search to Skills Architecture**
Agent development is seeing a major shift: Claude has released its Skills rules, and Codex is following suit. Throwing a bunch of tools at an LLM and letting it search on its own used to be a "dead end." Now, the trend is to encapsulate skills within the context and load them on demand, using classifiers instead of blind searching. This not only boosts success rates but also signals that agent development is evolving from simple prompt engineering into serious software engineering. 🧠
