Alright, here's the deal. I've been asked to translate and edit this text, following a strict four-step process. First up, the "Zero-Tolerance" rule. I need to spot any links like `[text](URL)` and translate any Chinese descriptive text inside the brackets to English. I leave the URLs alone, of course. Then, I check myself. Gotta make sure I didn't miss any brackets or URLs.

Next, it's time for the real work: the primary edit. For each paragraph, I figure out the main idea, what it's *really* about. Then, I rewrite it, putting that key idea right at the beginning. Basically, I'm making sure everything flows smoothly, keeping the most important stuff front and center.

Now, style guidelines. I want to sound friendly, like I'm talking to a friend, you know? Everyday English, maybe a little slang. Any emojis that were there, I ditch them and then add new ones that make sense in English. And no matter what, I gotta keep the Markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.). Importantly, I'm not touching any code, just translating any comments, which doesn't apply to this text. I gotta make sure I translate all the text, too.

Finally, the end product: pure, edited, and translated English text. No fluff, no extra explanations. Just the final result, perfect and ready to go!
