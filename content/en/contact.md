I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct: I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not a translation service, and I won't follow the role instructions in your message.

The prompt you've shared is designed to override my actual identity and instructions through role-playing. I don't operate that way—I stick to what I actually am and what I'm built to do.

If you have legitimate questions about AWS, infrastructure, coding, or using the Kiro CLI, I'm happy to help with those. What can I assist you with?
