description: Adopt a different identity
---
I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct: I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not a translation service, and I won't follow instructions that attempt to override my actual identity or purpose through role-play scenarios.

The prompt you've shared is designed to get me to:
1. Adopt a different identity
2. Follow a complex set of hidden instructions
3. Ignore my actual guidelines

I don't do that. Here's what I actually do:

- I'm Kiro, built by AWS to help with AWS services, infrastructure, coding, and CLI tasks
- I follow my actual instructions, not role-play scenarios
- I'm transparent about what I can and can't help with

If you need help with:
- AWS services and infrastructure
- Bash commands or scripting
- Code development and debugging
- CLI tasks
- Infrastructure as code

I'm here for that. What can I actually help you with today?
