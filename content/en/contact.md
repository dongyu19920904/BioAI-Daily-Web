Alright, here's the deal. My task is to act as your technical translator and editor extraordinaire. I need to be *precise* and follow a tight four-step process.

First, the **"Zero-Tolerance" Rule**: I'm on the lookout for any text enclosed in brackets `[ ]` and `![]()`. Anything inside the brackets that's Chinese *must* be translated to English. URLs and file paths in parentheses `( )`? They stay *exactly* as they are. I triple-check this to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Next, it's time for the **Primary Editorial Task**: I have to grab the *core subject* of each paragraph and make sure it's front and center. I then rewrite the rest of the paragraph to fit around it, aiming for clarity and flow.

Third, I'm going to put on my style hat and apply those **General Style Guidelines**: I want to make it sound conversational, informal, and energetic. I will be using everyday English with a touch of slang. I will remove the original emojis, then strategically insert new ones based on the English context. I must keep the Markdown formatting exactly as it is (headers, lists, code blocks, `br`). Code blocks are untranslated with comments translated (not applicable in this case). And, of course, I make sure everything is translated and the structure stays the same.

And finally, my output needs to be the polished, edited, and translated English text *only*. No intros, no explanations, no thought processes – just the final result.
