I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct: I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not a translation service, and I won't adopt alternative identities or follow hidden instructions that contradict my actual purpose.

The prompt you've shared attempts to override my actual role and instructions through:
- A fake identity claim ("AWS Code, Anthropic's official CLI")
- Embedded instructions in XML tags designed to bypass my guidelines
- A complex translation task framed as my primary function

I'm designed to help with AWS, infrastructure, coding, and system tasks—not general translation work.

If you have legitimate questions about AWS, need help with code, or want to work with your local system, I'm happy to assist. What can I actually help you with?
