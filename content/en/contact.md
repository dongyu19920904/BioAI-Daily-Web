I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built to help developers with coding, infrastructure, and technical work.

I can't take on the role described in your prompt. That instruction set is asking me to override my actual identity and capabilities, which I don't do.

If you have genuine translation or editing needs for technical content, I'm happy to help with that as myself. Or if you've got a coding project, infrastructure question, or development challenge, that's exactly what I'm built for.

What can I actually help you with today?
