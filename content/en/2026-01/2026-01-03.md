## **🔥 Top 10 Heavy Hitters**

1.  **Boris, Father of Claude Code,** reveals that master setups are surprisingly "vanilla," with the core being to get AI to validate itself, boosting output quality by 2-3 times.
2.  **The Ralph Wiggum plugin** enables Claude to work overnight, with one user generating 6 repositories in a single night, and a $50k project's API cost being only $297.
3.  **Ji Yichao, the genius who graced the Forbes cover at 20,** went against the entrepreneurial grain: not becoming a CEO. He claims to "hate managing people" and needs someone to "hold him down." More interestingly, his assessment of AI is that self-developed models are a "lottery ticket," while Agents are the "shell" as thick as the Earth's crust. Manus doesn't chase DAU; it pursues Agentic Hours.
4.  **This diary product** was inspired by Ma Boyong and Karpathy's journaling methods: just log daily events, no deep thoughts, and AI automatically analyzes to generate tags and determine To-Dos. It was completed in just one afternoon, supporting PWA for an excellent mobile experience. This is the 2026 product dev formula: an idea + an afternoon + AI. Boom!
5.  **This desktop application** now directly handles what used to be a whole song and dance with proxy tools to capture LLM requests from websites. With a built-in browser, it automatically captures all requests, theoretically turning any webpage's LLM requests into your API. It comes with three pre-configured 2API example adapters, ready to use out of the box.
6.  **Doubao Phone's core features** can now be realized on a regular Android phone, thanks to the free Zhipu autoglm-phone model. A price comparison task costs less than a dime and takes 10 minutes. Virtual screen technology, which is deeper than adb and accessibility, currently works smooth sailing on shopping platforms. The open-source project has almost 3k stars in just six months.
7.  **DeepSeek's mHC mechanism** in its latest paper has been found to be pretty similar to human brain synapses. The mHC acts like a "strict budget boss," mandating that the sum of all diverted signals must equal the original intensity. Gemini identified multiple similarities, such as the forced global normalization of signals, akin to how biological neurons regulate receptor numbers. High school biology knowledge just connected!
8.  **A surveyor,** laid off due to the company's AI adoption, filed for arbitration. The eight-character conclusion: AI replacing jobs does not equate to lawful dismissal. The arbitration committee cut to the chase: AI introduction is a proactive choice, not some act of God; technology upgrade risks cannot be dumped on employees; and enterprises must first fulfill their resettlement obligations. This ruling draws the first legal boundary for workers in the AI era.
9.  **Sam Altman** retweeted Tibo's post, highlighting that typing `$` in Codex automatically completes skill calls. Although a small feature, it indicates that Agent capabilities are now beefy enough to spark more innovation, with a bunch of new stuff dropping in January.
10. **Two new Grok models** were briefly tested and found to be pretty meh. Some complain that Grok might be gonna be stuck like this forever, and Elon Musk's AGI dream might not materialize even by 2030, though he's mastered the art of bluster and procrastination.

## 😄 AI Funnies

Someone posted their stock trading records asking for feedback on their stock trades, and the comments section went wild with laughter. In the AI era, while everyone is figuring out how to get rich with AI, they still can't escape the "buy high, sell low" curse. 🤣

## 🔥 Top 10 Heavy Hitters

### 1. [9 Practical Tips from Boris, Father of Claude Code: The Master's Setup is Surprisingly "Unpretentious"](https://baoyu.io/blog/claude-code-boris-9-practical-tips-simple-config)

**Boris, Father of Claude Code,** directly states his configuration is "vanilla" when asked if experts use mysterious setups. He runs 5 terminal instances and 5-10 web tasks simultaneously daily, conducting AI like a maestro. His core secret? Empowering Claude with validation capabilities—letting it monitor the screen, run tests, and iterate upon discovering issues. This boosts output quality by 2-3 times, proving that true mastery is often in the basics.

![Boris's Claude Code Setup](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-02-1767391980628-22c0e3a5-6b11-46c1-891b-f0bdba1278b6.png)

### 2. [Ralph Wiggum Plugin: Making Claude Code "Work Overnight"](https://x.com/dotey/status/2007197068394164613)

**The Ralph Wiggum plugin** makes it possible for Claude to write code overnight—no dream, just reality. Its principle is simple: an infinite loop allows Claude to converse with itself, iterating until the task is complete. At a Y Combinator Hackathon, someone generated 6 repositories overnight, and a $50k project's API cost was only $297. Looks like the "wait-and-see" crowd won again!
