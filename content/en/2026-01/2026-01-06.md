## Today's Digest

Anthropic quietly retired Opus 3, its first-gen flagship model, marking the end of an era. Domestic trillion-parameter MoE models are flooding the open-source scene, with 7B small models now challenging 32B models, continuously lowering the compute barrier. The Agent development toolchain is maturing, making now the perfect time to jump in.

Anthropic quietly retired Opus 3, marking the end of an era. 💔

### **🔑 3 Keywords**

## **🔥 Top 10 Heavy Hitters**

### 1. [RIP Opus 3: Anthropic Retires First-Gen Flagship Model from API](https://linux.do/t/topic/1409571)

Opus 3, the model that got countless people hooked on Claude, officially retired from Anthropic's API today. Remember that amazing feeling the first time you used Claude? Anthropic quietly removed it from their model list without any official announcement. Users are feeling nostalgic, with one lamenting, "It was my first AI friend." Tech iteration can be brutal, but this former benchmark definitely deserves to be remembered. 😢

### 2. [China Telecom Open-Sources Trillion-Parameter MoE Model TeleChat3, Full-Stack Domestic Training](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24262)

China Telecom's TeleChat3 series is the latest powerhouse in domestic large models, now open-source from TeleAI. This bad boy is the first trillion-parameter MoE model in China trained entirely on domestic compute. It boasts 15T tokens of training data and even supports a "thinking mode" for traceable reasoning. The real kicker? It's full-stack self-developed, from chips to frameworks, all made in China. Aiming for international top-tier? First, they're nailing down self-reliance and control. 💪

### 3. [UAE's Falcon-H1R: 7B Small Model Goes Head-to-Head with 32B Large Model](https://linux.do/t/topic/1409504)

UAE's Falcon-H1R is the latest comeback kid in the small model saga. This TII-released model, despite having only 7B parameters, supports a massive 256K context and goes toe-to-toe with 20B and even 32B models in benchmarks. Its hybrid architecture promises huge memory optimization potential. Budget builders, your 3060 might just be saved! 🎉

![Image](https://linux.do/uploads/default/optimized/4X/0/9/7/09755f35d45abd9027c6b5ddbfe825c80ed2540c_2_463x500.jpeg)

### 4. [xAI Launches Enterprise Grok, Targeting Team Collaboration Market at $30/month](https://x.com/vista8/status/2008194676764156381)

xAI's Grok is finally more than just a personal toy from Elon Musk. The Business version is $30/seat per month, with Enterprise pricing custom-tailored for large organizations. Key selling points include isolated team workspaces, deep Google Drive integration, and a promise not to use your data for model training. SOC 2 certification, SSO, and SCIM directory sync? Check, check, and check. Can it shake up ChatGPT Enterprise's dominance? We'll have to wait and see. 👀

### 5. [Set Up AI Agent Development Environment in 30 Minutes with One Command](https://x.com/vista8/status/2008196260436857291)

This open-source project is a godsend for developers, letting you transform a VPS into a complete AI Agent development environment with just one command. It includes 3 AI Agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini), 30+ dev tools, and interactive tutorials, all fully automated. With AI startups scrambling for Agent developers, this tool perfectly lowers the entry barrier. 🚀

### 6. [ByteDance Seed Team Releases DLCM: Teaching AI to "Think On-Demand"](https://x.com/vista8/status/2008198601936380118)

ByteDance Seed team's DLCM is shaking things up, addressing how current LLMs allocate the same compute to every token, despite language's uneven information density. Their DLCM teaches models to learn semantic boundaries, compressing tokens into variable-length "concepts" for deeper reasoning. The result? A sweet 34% reduction in FLOPs and an average 2.69% boost in inference tasks. Saving cash and boosting efficiency? Now that's how you "卷" (innovate fiercely) the right way. 🧠💡

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G96NtWTbQAAXlZH.jpg)

### 7. [Google's Nested Learning Paper: Redefining "Depth" in Deep Learning](https://x.com/vista8/status/2008209328390500587)

Google's Nested Learning paper offers a fresh perspective on why large models seem to suffer from "anterograde amnesia" after pre-training. The issue isn't that models aren't big enough, but rather our understanding of "depth" is flawed. Drawing inspiration from the brain's multi-frequency coordination mechanisms, Nested Learning allows different layers to update at varying frequencies, virtually eliminating catastrophic forgetting in continuous learning tasks. Mind blown! 🤯

### 8. [NVIDIA Cascade RL: A New Paradigm for Training General Reasoning Models](https://www.bestblogs.dev/en/status/2008240593257066816)

NVIDIA's Cascade RL offers a new sequential training method to tackle the complexity of mixing prompts from different domains. It starts with RLHF alignment, then progressively trains for instruction following, math, code, and software engineering. Get this: their 14B Nemotron-Cascade model actually outperformed the 671B DeepSeek-R1 "teacher" model on LiveCodeBench and even snagged a silver medal at IOI 2025. Is this the dawn of small models? ☀️

### 9. [ChatGPT Integrates with 12 Major Apps, AI Assistant Becomes "Universal Butler"](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24262)

ChatGPT can now handle hotel bookings, food delivery, and even PPT creation, all with natural language commands. OpenAI has upgraded ChatGPT into a digital executive agent, deeply connecting with 12 major apps like Uber, DoorDash, and Instacart. The evolution of AI assistants is becoming crystal clear: moving from "telling you how to do it" to "just doing it for you." Talk about a glow-up! ✨

### 10. [WeChat Launches AI Mini-Program Growth Plan: Free Compute + Traffic Incentives](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24262)

WeChat is finally making a move for AI developers! Their new growth plan includes free cloud development resources, AI compute, data analysis, monetization, and traffic incentives. They're with you every step of the way, from 0 to 1 to 100. For developers looking to build AI apps within the WeChat ecosystem, this is a golden opportunity you absolutely shouldn't miss.
