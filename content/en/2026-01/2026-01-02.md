## **Today's Digest**

GitHub just dropped three absolute gems: an 80K-star large model app collection, a CEO survival guide, and an Agent pitfall avoidance guide – seriously, developers, you gotta grab these! Xiaohongshu's 7B model is smashing video reasoning benchmarks, Meta's teaching Agents to evolve through self-play, and domestic code models are flipping GPT on its head. Today's a perfect day to bookmark tutorials and try out new tools. For those on the fence, maybe wait and see.

## **Today's AI News**

### **👀 Just One Sentence**
Developers, guess what? Three more treasure trove tutorial repos just surfaced on GitHub, bringing you an AI Agent practical pitfall avoidance guide.

## **🔥 Top 10 Heavy Hitters**

### 1. [Three GitHub Treasure Trove Tutorial Repos: Large Model APP Collection, CEO Survival Manual, AI Agent Practical Guide](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxNjg4NDEzNA==&mid=2247530299&idx=1&sn=806d0ccb1258d1c1df7f41e57e00b6cb)

This 80K-star open-source project is a goldmine, packed with ready-to-use code for building PDF-reading bots or Agent teams that auto-generate reports. What's even better? It's not just focused on OpenAI; you'll find examples for Anthropic, Gemini, and even local large models. Plus, there's a survival manual for tech-savvy CEOs covering fundraising, hiring, and financial management, along with an Agent design patterns library specifically designed to tackle that "demo works, production breaks" problem. A must-bookmark for developers!

### 2. [Xiaohongshu Video-Thinker: Models Find Keyframes Themselves, 7B Parameters Refresh Video Reasoning SOTA](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2651010206&idx=2&sn=6b8897d57a59b91dd33362f6c79d38a8)

Xiaohongshu's Video-Thinker just pulled off something big. Previously, video reasoning models were passive receivers, needing a bunch of external tools. This new approach internalizes "temporal localization" and "visual description" directly into the model's chain of thought. Trained with just 10K data, its 7B parameters crushed a bunch of large models on benchmarks like Video-Holmes. The most impressive part? The model "looks back" – it checks its own localization for accuracy. This level of meta-cognition is pretty wild.

### 3. [Meta's Big Move: SSR Frees Agents from Human Data Bottlenecks, a Key Step Towards Autonomous AI](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2651010206&idx=3&sn=f647fa9564c34e340d559fa613ab291b)

Meta's new SSR framework tackles a fatal flaw in current programming Agents: their over-reliance on human training data. This framework lets a single model play two roles – one injecting bugs, the other fixing them – evolving continuously through self-play. It boosted performance on SWE-bench by 10.4 percentage points, all without needing manually labeled issues or test cases. Applying AlphaGo's self-play concept to code? This path has definitely proven successful.

### 4. [AiBal: One-Stop Tracking for API Usage and Balances Across Multiple AI Service Providers](https://linux.do/t/topic/1397497)

If you're juggling multiple services like Claude, GPT, and Gemini, rejoice! AiBal is an open-source tool that lets you see each provider's quota consumption and remaining balance at a glance, right from your menu bar. It even supports plugin extensions. macOS users can dive right in, and it's also available as a package for Windows and Linux. No more worrying about an API suddenly running out of credit!

### 5. [Silicon Valley's 'Dropout Entrepreneurship' Trend Resurges: But the Real Variable Has Never Been the Degree](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2651010206&idx=1&sn=15f8af53c779e55a6006625efcd87715)

The "dropout entrepreneurship" trend is resurfacing in Silicon Valley, with more founders at YC Demo Day actively highlighting their dropout status. Some students are even ditching their degrees in their final semester, believing a diploma might actually hurt their fundraising chances. But let's be real: Cursor's CEO graduated from MIT, and Cognition's co-founder is a Harvard alum. Dropping out is just the surface; ability, judgment, and timing are the true core variables.

### 6. [Tencent Hunyuan Motion 1.0: Open-Source Text-to-3D Action Model with Billions of Parameters](https://linux.do/t/topic/1397404)

Tencent Hunyuan Motion 1.0 is an open-source text-to-3D action model that can generate fluid 3D character animations from natural language descriptions and seamlessly integrate into existing 3D art animation pipelines. Built on the DiT architecture and flow matching mechanism, it covers a wide range of action categories. Game developers and animators, keep an eye on this one – it could save you a ton of manual keyframing time!

### 7. [Alibaba Qwen-Image-2512 Local Deployment Guide: Say Goodbye to AI Faces and Garbled Text](https://linux.do/t/topic/1397289)

Alibaba's Qwen-Image-2512 is a domestic text-to-image model that has finally solved the long-standing headache of rendering Chinese text accurately. This model can precisely generate complex Chinese characters, and its compositions align better with Eastern aesthetics. It runs on just 16GB of VRAM, and the tutorial clearly outlines everything from environment setup to model download. If you're looking to run it locally, give it a shot!

![Image](https://linux.do/uploads/default/original/4X/c/9/9/c99889fe1f467f22060aee3427491f6831e14017.jpeg)

### 8. [ByteDance Launches Manus-like Agent: AnyGen is Free and Faster](https://linux.do/t/topic/1396675)

ByteDance just launched AnyGen, an Agent similar to Manus, and after trying it out, it's way better! It's free to use, deducting points for usage, with 200 points daily that deplete slowly. You'll need a VPN to register, and it only links with Google, Apple, and LARK accounts. Invite two friends, and you get a month of PRO for free. If you're curious about Agent capabilities, you can totally snag this one for free.

### 9. [Qubit: 'Beijing's Magic Square' Open-Source SOTA Code Large Model, 40B Parameters Overthrow Opus-4.5 and GPT-5.2](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247859736&idx=1&sn=6731d555d78d4ec9e15330ee7a3afbc7)

Qubit's IQuest-Coder-V1 model series just exploded with performance on SWE-Bench Verified, and get this – it can run on a single 3090 GPU! Another new Chinese model is in the spotlight, dominating headlines in tech circles both domestically and internationally. Open-source enthusiasts are overjoyed!

### 10. [Ma Boyong's Diary Method + AI: Best Practices for Low-Friction Recording](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6957423ff9f742324f762a59)

Ma Boyong's diary method, where he records only facts and not feelings, is echoed by Karpathy's append-only approach of dropping notes at the top of a document. This stream-of-consciousness recording style offers extremely low friction, and pure text is super friendly to AI – tens of thousands of words a year perfectly suited for large model contexts. If you're looking to build your personal AI memory, this method is definitely worth a try.
