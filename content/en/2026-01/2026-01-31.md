## **🔥 Top 10 Headlines**

### 1. [AlphaGenome Graces Nature Cover, DeepMind Opens Model Weights to Academia](https://x.com/demishassabis/status/2016763919646478403)

Remember the shock when AlphaFold predicted protein structures? This time, DeepMind is zooming in on something even more fundamental—DNA itself. AlphaGenome can predict how genetic variants impact molecular outcomes. In plain English: feed it a DNA sequence, and it tells you what happens when that code "runs." The kicker? Model weights are open to academic researchers. Demis Hassabis tweeted the celebration himself—this is another milestone moment for AI in life sciences, right after AlphaFold.

### 2. [ORILINX: Mapping DNA Replication Origins with Genomic Language Models](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.29.702604v1?rss=1)

Where does DNA replication kick off? Scientists have been scratching their heads over this for ages. Now, a research team has "trained" a genomic language model into a replication origin detector. Here's the fun part: the model learned features way beyond what humans already know about GC content and G-quadruplex motifs—it discovered new patterns on its own. Even better, the method works not just for humans but scales to mice, sheep, and even chickens. Code's open-sourced, so you can dive in right now.

### 3. [CytoVerse: Single-Cell AI Foundation Model Running Straight in Your Browser](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.29.702554v1?rss=1)

Used to be, single-cell analysis meant either queuing for server time or sweating over data privacy. CytoVerse says: forget both. It stuffs a single-cell RNA-seq foundation model into your browser using ONNX, zero server-side compute needed. The wild part? It can search a reference database of over 20 million cells client-side. For cross-institutional collaboration, this means you can share analysis results without exposing raw data. Privacy advocates are losing their minds in the best way.

### 4. [Open-Health: Open-Source AI Health Assistant, Your Data, Your Rules](https://github.com/OpenHealthForAll/open-health)

Most health apps either charge you or harvest your data for ads. Open-Health took a different path: fully open-source, data stays local. It integrates various health metrics and uses AI to serve up personalized recommendations. Already sitting at 3,795 stars on GitHub—clearly hitting a nerve. Want a health manager that doesn't spy on you? Worth a shot.

---

### 5. [WellAlly-Health: Intelligent Medical Assistant Powered by Claude AI](https://github.com/huifer/WellAlly-health)

What happens when you combine Claude's conversational chops with medical expertise? WellAlly-Health shows you. It logs symptoms, manages medications, tracks medical history, and even offers multi-disciplinary consultation analysis. Won't replace your actual doctor, but as a daily health management sidekick? This combo is seriously solid. 671 stars and climbing.

---

### 6. [SparkyFitness: AI Health Tracking System for the Whole Family](https://github.com/CodeWithCJ/SparkyFitness)

Solo fitness grind gets old fast—what about the whole family? SparkyFitness was built for exactly that: track diet, workouts, water intake, health metrics, all together. 2,086 stars prove family health management is a real need. AI-powered features mean it's not just a logging tool—it dishes out personalized advice too.

### 7. [Genomic Language Models Decode MYC Locus, Uncover Druggable Ultra-Conserved RNA Elements](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.29.702547v1?rss=1)

MYC is cancer research's "old friend," but it's always been tough to crack. This study used CRISPR saturation mutagenesis to map the MYC locus at base-pair resolution and found something wild: 67% of functionally essential base pairs are non-coding. More importantly, they spotted an ultra-conserved RNA element in the 3' UTR region. Target it with antisense oligonucleotides and you selectively kill MYC-dependent cancer cells. New therapeutic target on the horizon? Definitely worth watching.

### 8. [deepmriprep: Brain MRI Preprocessing with Deep Neural Networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-026-00953-7)

Brain MRI voxel-based morphometry (VBM) preprocessing has always been a time sink. deepmriprep automated the whole workflow with deep learning, published in Nature Computational Science. For neuroimaging researchers, that means faster processing and more consistent results.

---

### 9. [Trustworthy Enzyme Classification Prediction: Hierarchical Interpretable Transformer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68727-3)

Predicting enzyme EC numbers sounds academic, but it's crucial for drug development and metabolic engineering. This Nature Communications paper presents a hierarchical interpretable Transformer that nails accuracy *and* explains its reasoning. Interpretability is becoming increasingly important in biotech AI.

---

### 10. [BrainFuse: Unified Infrastructure Bridging Biological Neural Modeling and AI](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2601.21407)

Neuroscience and AI should be best friends, but reality? AI frameworks don't support biophysical details, and neural simulators aren't built for gradient optimization. BrainFuse tries to tear down that wall, deploying roughly 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons and 1 billion synapses on a single neuromorphic chip, burning just 1.98W. If you're keen on bringing real neural dynamics into AI, this is a tool worth tracking.
