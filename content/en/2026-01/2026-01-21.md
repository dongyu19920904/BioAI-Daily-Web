## **🔥 Top 7 Highlights**

### [How the Brain Understands Language Is Shockingly Similar to GPT](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000308.htm)

We always thought AI was "mimicking" the brain, but scientists just discovered something wild: the way your brain understands language is almost identical to how GPT and other large models work. Researchers had volunteers listen to long podcasts while tracking brain activity, and found that the brain processes meaning layer by layer—just like Transformer architecture does. So is AI learning from the brain, or is the brain basically a "biological Transformer"? Mind-bending stuff.

### [HealthChain: The "Middleware" Medical AI Has Been Missing](https://github.com/dotimplement/HealthChain)

The real headache in medical AI development isn't the model—it's integrating with hospital systems. HealthChain calls itself "the missing middleware layer for medical AI" and handles the messy stuff: FHIR data formats, clinical workflow integration, all that unglamorous work. With 176 stars, it's worth a shot if you're serious about getting AI into actual hospitals.
