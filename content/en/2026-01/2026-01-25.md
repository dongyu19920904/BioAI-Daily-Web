## **Today's AI Life Sciences News**

### **👀 One-Liner That Got Me Excited**
Today's biggest wow moment: someone just used generative AI to "bidirectionally translate" cell morphology and gene expression—meaning you can look at what a cell looks like and predict what genes it's expressing.

## **🔥 Top 10 Must-Reads**

### 1. [COSMIC: Read Gene Expression Straight from Cell Morphology](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.22.700673v1?rss=1)

Used to be you'd either look at cells or sequence their genes—never both at once. Now COSMIC breaks that wall down. Trained on 21 million cell nuclei, this framework predicts gene expression from cell morphology and works in reverse too. In prostate cancer cells, it can even tell which ones respond to chemo and which ones are playing dead. For drug screening and tumor research? Game changer.

### 2. [Deep Learning Sees Right Through Tumors: Benign or Malignant? Where'd It Come From?](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-026-02359-1)

Pathologists' nightmare: you get a slide—is this tumor malignant? Where's the primary site? This Nature sub-journal study uses deep learning on whole-slide images (WSI) to nail both the malignancy call and tumor origin prediction, whether it's cytology or histopathology. Pathology diagnostics are about to get a serious speed and accuracy boost.
