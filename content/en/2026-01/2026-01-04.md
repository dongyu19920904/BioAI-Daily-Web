## **🔥 Top 10 Hot Takes**

### 1. [Code Review in the AI Era: Writing Twice is Faster](https://baoyu.io/blog/ai-era-code-review-write-twice-faster)

**What was the biggest pain point in coding before?** You'd get the first version running, only to realize you misunderstood half the requirements, the architecture couldn't handle iterations, and your boss wouldn't let you rewrite it. Three years later, that code became a "shit mountain" no one dared touch.

**Now, AI** writes code ridiculously fast; a three-day task can yield a runnable version in three hours. This has turned the "prototype development method" from theory into practice: **the first version lets AI run wild, ignoring architecture and quality, just to uncover all the pitfalls; the second version then returns to traditional engineering, with proper design and review.** Admitting the first version is disposable actually leads to a better second version.

### 2. [Claude Code Creator Boris Reveals 13 Core Principles](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TQ13vs9IPCtEM19k7b2f_Q)

**Boris, the creator of Claude Code**, shares his secret: how does one person command a silicon army? His answer: **run 15-20 Claude instances simultaneously!** He'll have 5 tabs open in the terminal and another 5-10 pages in the browser, switching back and forth to push things forward in parallel.

**His core principles** are two-fold: **Compound Interest Thinking** – CLAUDE.md isn't a one-off document; it's a knowledge base the team adds to weekly, improving with every code review. And **Validation Feedback** – give Claude a way to validate its work, and the final quality can improve 2-3 times. He exclusively uses Opus 4.5 + thinking mode, for a straightforward reason: comparing and correcting once is faster than doing it repeatedly.

### 3. [Yann LeCun Leaves Meta to Start New "World Model" Company](https://x.com/vista8/status/2007397650438767050)

**Yann LeCun's exclusive interview with the Financial Times** is packed with juicy details. The "Godfather of AI," after over a decade at Meta, is now leaving. His reason is blunt: **the company's new hires are "completely brainwashed by LLMs,"** while he firmly believes large language models won't achieve superhuman intelligence.

**Even more explosive is the internal gossip**: Llama 4's launch "results were a bit beautified," which apparently made Zuckerberg furious. Plus, the 28-year-old Scale AI CEO became his new boss. LeCun's response? "You can't tell researchers what to do, especially not researchers like me." His new company aims to build a "world model" based on the V-JEPA architecture, with a "baby version" expected within 12 months.

### 4. [Claude Code LSP Tool Has Race Condition Bug, Community Releases Fix Script](https://linux.do/t/topic/1401997)

**Heads up, Claude Code developers!** Versions after 2.0.67 (from 2.0.69 to the latest 2.0.76) all share a common issue: the **LSP Server plugin shows "Enabled," but it's not actually loaded correctly**, and LSPManager displays "0 Server."

**The problem** stems from the configuration file loading order, where the `initialize()` function is empty. A community expert has already penned a fix script that uses the Acorn parser to locate and patch the relevant function. The script supports `--check` for verification, `--restore` for reverting changes, and `--fix-plugins` to mend plugin configurations.

### 5. [Claudian: A Plugin to Use Claude SDK Directly in Obsidian](https://x.com/vista8/status/2007371786539749837)

**Claudian** is even better than the Terminal plugin! It **can read your current Obsidian content for context processing**, and it even works with third-party proxies or domestic alternatives to Claude.

**Installation is a breeze**: Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from GitHub, place them in the `claudian` directory within your Obsidian plugins folder, then restart. If you get a "Claude CLI not found" error, you'll need to install the SDK in your system terminal first.

### 7. [Context Engineering Interview Question Goes Viral: How to Design read_file, write_file?](https://x.com/dotey/status/2007524872629387382)

**A viral interview question**, reshared by Baoyu, is said to "really show a candidate's caliber." It asks: how would you design `read_file` and `write_file` in a specific business scenario? **If your answer is just about reading and writing concrete files, well, the interview might just end there.**

**This question** truly tests your deep understanding of context engineering. How would you answer? 🤔

### 10. [Built a Two-Dimensional Yuri Website with AI: Claude > Gemini >> GPT](https://linux.do/t/topic/1401971)

**Using the same prompt**, the creator ran it through ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude web versions. The verdict? **Claude Opus 4.5 was a real eye-opener**! Gemini 3 Pro's aesthetic wasn't top-tier, but its typewriter details were spot on. GPT-5.2 Thinking, however, couldn't even fetch images or dialogue. Oof.

**Website address**: bjmu.edu.kg. Source code is available in the GitHub repository.

## **😄 AI Funnies**

### [Remember to Back Up Files When Using Antigravity!!!](https://linux.do/t/topic/1401987)

**The most absurd AI news today**: Google's Antigravity can modify your code and asks if you want to accept. **But here's the kicker – if you hit "reject accept," it deletes the *entire modified code*!** Original code overwritten → asks to accept → reject deletes the overwritten code → original code vanishes. Seriously, Google, what were you thinking with this anti-human operation? 😇
