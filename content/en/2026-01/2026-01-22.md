## **🔥 Top 7 Headlines**

### [How the Human Brain Understands Language Is Shockingly Similar to AI](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000308.htm)

We used to think the human brain was a one-of-a-kind "black box" and AI was just mimicking it. Turns out, scientists tracked brain activity while people listened to podcasts and discovered something wild: the way brains process language actually mirrors how GPT-style models work through layered processing. It unfolds step by step, layer by layer. This finding is pretty mind-blowing—either AI has cracked how the brain works, or the brain itself is basically a "biological neural network." For folks working on brain-computer interfaces and cognitive AI, this could be a game-changer.
