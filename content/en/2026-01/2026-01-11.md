## **🔥 Top 10 Hot Takes**

### 1. [Tailwind CSS Founder Reveals: 75% Layoffs, 80% Revenue Drop](https://x.com/op7418/status/2010042743184339176)

Tailwind CSS's story is probably the most ironic of the AI era. It's used by almost every major AI coding tool, hitting an all-time high in adoption—yet its revenue has fallen off a cliff. The reason is simple: developers used to check docs and stumble upon paid products like Tailwind UI. Now, AI just writes the code for them. Who needs to flip through docs anymore? The good news? Google has swooped in with a donation. OpenAI and Anthropic, though? Still playing dead. This case is a wake-up call for all open-source projects: when AI "eats up" all your knowledge, how long can your business model survive?

### 2. [Anthropic's Full Blockade: XAI, Open Code Reverse Proxy Channels Shut Down](https://x.com/op7418/status/2009984648965943609)

Anthropic is getting serious this time. They've not only blocked XAI's access to Claude models but also shut down services like Open Code that used reverse proxies to get Claude subscriptions. If you've got a fresh Claude Code install and want to use a third-party API, you'll need to manually add parameters to bypass login. It's safe to say, the battle to block Claude Code's third-party APIs has just begun. This is bad news for developers who love to "milk the system," but a golden opportunity for teams looking to build alternative solutions.

### 3. [OpenAI Officially Embraces Open Code: Plus/Pro Users Can Directly Authorize Use](https://x.com/op7418/status/2010031968399028555)

OpenAI is taking a completely different approach from Anthropic's lockdown strategy. In Open Code v1.1.11, OpenAI Pro and Plus users can now directly authorize login via their browser, safely using the Codex model within Open Code without fear of account suspension. This "openness for ecosystem" play is a huge hit with the developer community. The strategic divergence between the two companies is becoming clearer: one is building walls, the other is tearing them down.

### 4. [China AI Roundtable Transcript: Let's Admit It, Our Biggest Problem is "Poverty"](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6962523f5415148f2b15d07a)

At the AGI-Next closed-door meeting, big names like Yang Qiang, Tang Jie, Lin Junyang, and Yao Shunyu dropped some sobering truths. Alibaba's Lin Junyang stated bluntly: OpenAI's computing power is 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than ours. They're "wasting" compute on exploration, while we're just barely keeping up with business demands. When asked about the probability of China leading in AI in 3-5 years, the answer was 20%. But Professor Tang Jie shared a touching thought: "If we stubbornly persist, maybe we'll be the ones to make it to the end." This clear-eyed pessimism is far more powerful than blind optimism.

### 5. [Google Antigravity Can't Hold On: Pro Users Now Have Limits](https://x.com/op7418/status/2009982977510658177)

Google Antigravity got milked dry! They've announced weekly usage limits for Pro users, though Ultra users are safe for now. The official line is "balancing optimal allocation with user fairness," but in plain English, it means: "You guys are using too much, and we can't handle the costs." This move means heavy Antigravity users might need to start looking for a Plan B.

### 6. [Dia CEO: If You Don't Use Claude Code's Native Workflow, You'll Be Left Behind](https://x.com/op7418/status/2009980053149663720)

Dia's CEO, Josh Miller, is sending a strong signal: if your team doesn't adopt Claude Code as its native workflow soon, you'll be left behind, just like those who didn't embrace mobile-native in the 2010s. His company is already seeing interesting shifts: designers are frequently submitting PRs, and non-engineers can independently prototype. The overall effect? More experiments, faster learning—like giving the team a "code e-bike." Apple's former Safari lead designer just joined them, so it looks like they're gearing up for something big.

### 7. [Open-WebUI Major Update: Native Function Calling + Performance Leap](https://linux.do/t/topic/1427438)

Open-WebUI just dropped v0.7.0 and v0.7.1 back-to-back, and these updates are packed with value. The biggest highlight is native function calling: users can now have the model perform multiple tasks in one conversation, like web searches, knowledge base queries, note-taking, and image generation. Imagine saying, "Research the latest advancements in X, save the key points to my notes, then generate an infographic"—all done in one go. Plus, database connection handling has been refactored, leading to significant improvements in page load speed and stability. If you're building your own AI interface, it's time to upgrade!

### 8. [Claude Code Visual Workflow Editor: GitHub 2300 Stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxNjg4NDEzNA==&mid=2247530482&idx=1&sn=80e975e2997f28dcbee2ab4a86d25189)

If you find Claude Code's configuration files a bit too complex, this VS Code plugin is your savior. The ClaudeCode Workflow Studio lets you design automated tasks like drawing a flowchart—drag nodes, connect lines, export, and boom, you've got a Claude Code-ready configuration file. Feeling even lazier? Just describe your needs in natural language, and AI will draw the nodes and connect the lines for you. All logic runs locally, so no privacy worries, and it even supports a Chinese interface.

### 9. [makepad-skills Open Source: Develop Full-Stack Rust Cross-Platform Apps with Claude Code](https://x.com/dotey/status/2010073854190997957)

Good news for Rust developers! AlexZ's open-source makepad-skills lets you rapidly develop full-stack Rust cross-platform apps (desktop/mobile/Web/VR) using Claude Code. Just copy the skills file to your project's .claude/skills directory, and you'll get the power of "ten years of Rust experience + two years of Makepad development prowess." The author used this tool to build a currency exchange app in 20 minutes and also created a component library inspired by Changqiao gpui-component.

### 10. [Achieve Progressive Disclosure for MCP Tools Without Skills](https://linux.do/t/topic/1427188)

This tech share is pretty interesting. The author discovered that Anthropic's Skills are essentially prompt injections, but they come with security risks and dependency issues. So, he took a different approach: since CLI tools have a `--help` parameter, why not design MCPs in the same style? He converted the official PDF Skill into an MCP that exposes only one tool, achieving progressive disclosure via the `--help` parameter. Tests showed good results, significantly reducing context window usage. The code is open source, so if you're curious, dive in!

## **😄 AI Fun Fact**

### [Codex Head Accuses Claude of Buying Google Search Rankings](https://linux.do/t/topic/1427346)

It's a "palace drama" in the AI coding tool world! The head of Codex publicly accused Claude of buying Google search rankings, sparking an all-out war between the two. The comments section exploded, with onlookers eagerly saying, "Finally, the gods are fighting!" Regardless of the truth, this war of words proves one thing: the competition among AI coding tools has become so fierce that even search rankings are a battleground. 🍿
