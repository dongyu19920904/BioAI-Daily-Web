#GoogleComeback #GmailTransformation #OpenSourceSurge

## **🔥 Top 10 Blockbusters**

### 1. [Wall Street Journal Long Read Reveals: How Google Overtook OpenAI](https://x.com/dotey/status/2009352478798590139)

This ten-thousand-word article from the Wall Street Journal spills the beans on Google's decade-long strategy. It all started at 2:30 AM in August 2025, when an image generator called "Nano Banana" quietly launched, skyrocketing to the top of the charts within days. By November, Gemini was crushing ChatGPT across multiple metrics, sending OpenAI into an internal "Code Red." The article covers everything from Google's self-developed TPU chips and DeepMind integration to the Bard flop and Sergey Brin's return. The kicker? Google is reportedly negotiating with Meta to sell chips, a rumor that sent Nvidia's stock tumbling 7% the day it broke.

### 2. [Gmail Officially Enters the Gemini Era: Mailbox Transforms into an AI Assistant](https://x.com/dotey/status/2009321627390259462)

Gmail has officially entered the Gemini era, transforming your mailbox into an AI assistant. Remember sifting through your inbox for ages to find important emails? Now, Gmail sorts them by priority for you. The AI inbox acts like a briefing page, pinning overdue bills and appointment reminders right at the top. The search bar now supports natural language queries, so you can ask things like, "Who was the plumber who quoted me for bathroom renovations last year?"—and Gemini will dig it up for you. Basic features are free, with advanced ones requiring a Pro/Ultra subscription. Currently, it's rolling out in English in the US first. Your email is no longer just a tool for sending and receiving messages; it's a whole new beast.

### 3. [Alibaba Qwen Releases Multimodal Embedding and Reranking Models](https://linux.do/t/topic/1421266)

Alibaba's Qwen3-VL-Embedding and Qwen3-VL-Reranker models are here, unifying text, images, screenshots, videos, and mixed modalities into a single semantic space. What does this mean? Previously, these were all retrieved separately, but now you can search images and documents simultaneously with just one query. Multimodal RAG finally has a reliable open-source solution! These are the first batch of open-source models based on Qwen3-VL, specifically designed for cross-modal understanding.

### 4. [Claude Code 2.1.0 Update: Skill Hot Reload is Here](https://x.com/vista8/status/2009280375353430365)

Claude Code 2.1.0 just dropped an update, and Skill hot reload is finally here! What's the most annoying thing when debugging skills? Having to restart after every single line of code change. Now, Claude Code supports hot updates, so your changes take effect immediately. You can also see your created skills with the "/" command, leading to more stable execution. No need to exit CC; just type `claude update` to get the latest. These are all pain points discovered during recent usage, and Anthropic's iteration speed is seriously impressive.

### 5. [Open-Source Search Agent MiroThinker 1.5: 30B Parameters Crushes Trillion-Parameter Models](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxNjg4NDEzNA==&mid=2247530418&idx=1&sn=d983720f54ccc4c953aef2f8397d172c)

MiroThinker 1.5, an open-source search agent, isn't about massive parameter counts. Instead, it lets AI go wild researching, coding, and iterating like a human. This 30B parameter model has already surpassed ChatGPT-Agent in BrowseComp tests, all at just 1/30th of the cost! Its core tech, "Interactive Expansion," means it doesn't just guess when faced with uncertainty; it breaks down problems, retrieves evidence, and refines answers through multiple rounds. With over 2300+ Stars on GitHub, it's a fresh deep research option for the open-source community.

### 6. [Tencent Hunyuan Open-Sources HY-Motion1.0: 3D Character Animation Generation](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24417)

Tencent Hunyuan's HY-Motion1.0 is a godsend for game developers and animators! This billion-parameter model, built on a Diffusion Transformer architecture, can generate smooth, coherent skeletal animations. It covers over 200 action categories, including basic movements, daily life, and social interactions. Remember those late nights tweaking keyframes for 3D animation? Well, the barrier to entry just got significantly lower.

### 7. [Zhipu AI Listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange: Opens Up 3%, Market Cap Exceeds HK$43 Billion](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24417)

Zhipu AI has officially listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, opening up 3% with a market cap exceeding HK$43 billion! This marks a new phase for domestic large model companies, where commercialization is key. While R&D investment continues to climb, turning that into actual commercial success remains the critical challenge. The capital market has given a nod to its technical barriers and long-term potential, so now it's all about whether they can make that money back.

### 8. [Cerebras Lists GLM 4.7: One Word, Fast](https://linux.do/t/topic/1421550)

Cerebras's big advantage is its inference speed, and now GLM 4.7 is running on it too! This is awesome news for scenarios demanding low-latency responses.

### 9. [Open-Source Android AI Chat Software TChat Updates to v1.7](https://linux.do/t/topic/1421531)

### 10. [DIY Document API to Claude Code Skill: Easily Research Social Platforms Across the Web](https://linux.do/t/topic/1421121)

## **😄 AI Funnies**
### [Xiamen Lab UNITY Model Logic Test Fails](https://linux.do/t/topic/1421537)

The Xiamen Lab's UNITY model, which claimed to surpass many domestic and international large models, totally fumbled a classic logic puzzle! The question was: "If you don't put the red ball in the blue box, does that mean there's definitely no red ball in the blue box?" The correct answer is "Not necessarily," because "I didn't put it in" doesn't mean "it wasn't there already" or "someone else didn't put it in." UNITY's reasoning process looked super comprehensive and well-organized, but its final answer was "definitely not"—proving that no matter how long your chain of thought, a wrong answer is still a wrong answer. 🤦‍♀️
