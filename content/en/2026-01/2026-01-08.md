## 🔥 Top 10 News

1.  OpenAI Officially Launches "ChatGPT Health": Your AI Private Doctor is Here ([https://x.com/dotey/status/2009004490297585834](https://x.com/dotey/status/2009004490297585834))

    ChatGPT Health? It's a game-changer! Before, asking ChatGPT about health felt like talking to a textbook. Now, you can directly link up Apple Health and electronic medical records, letting it analyze your check-up reports and whip up custom recovery plans. OpenAI even got over 260 doctors to evaluate it and built a 'privacy moat' – your health data is totally isolated and won't be used for training. The waitlist is open now, with Plus/Pro users getting priority. This AI assistant has officially leveled up from a 'walking encyclopedia' to your very own 'personal health consultant'! 🚀

2.  Claude Code 2.1.0 Major Update: Released and Withdrawn in Under an Hour ([https://linux.do/t/topic/1417927](https://linux.do/t/topic/1417927))

    Anthropic's move with Claude Code 2.1.0? Pure chaos! 🤯 They dropped a massive update in the wee hours – hot reloading, multi-language support, Vim enhancements, a bunch of bug fixes... only to pull it back in less than an hour! The culprit? A version number parsing bug that made it crash on startup. The official GitHub issue went from open to closed in just 25 minutes. Talk about a 'drop and run'! Developers were laughing until they cried. 🤣

3.  Google Acquires g.ai Domain ([https://linux.do/t/topic/1417881](https://linux.do/t/topic/1417881))

    Google just snagged the g.ai domain! 🤩 It's just two letters, but man, does it pack a punch. Logan Kilpatrick from Google officially announced on X that g.ai is now in their pocket. This domain is super sleek and will likely become the unified entry point for all Google AI products. In the domain world, it's prime real estate, and Google just scored another win! 🏆

4.  Musk: New Grok Imagine Version Released ([https://linux.do/t/topic/1417665](https://linux.do/t/topic/1417665))

    Elon Musk dropped a late-night tweet: 'New Grok Imagine just released, update your App quick!' The tweet came with a dreamy AI-generated night scene. Grok's image generation has always been a big selling point for X Premium. While the exact improvements aren't clear yet, Musk himself getting personally involved in the promo shows xAI is super confident about this iteration. If you wanna try it out, go update your app ASAP! ✨

5.  Amap Releases FantasyWorld World Model, Tops WorldScore Rankings ([https://x.com/op7418/status/2008882992102637593](https://x.com/op7418/status/2008882992102637593))

    Amap (Gaode) is now flexing its muscles in the world model arena! 🗺️ They just unveiled FantasyWorld, which absolutely crushed the WorldScore test set, taking the top spot. This model can jointly model video latent variables and implicit 3D fields, producing videos with outstanding multi-view consistency and geometric fidelity. As autonomous driving shifts towards purely visual solutions, world models that chase physical realism are only going to get more crucial. Looks like Alibaba's AI empire just added another feather to its cap! 👑

6.  Liquid AI Releases LFM2.5: A Family of Small AI Models for Edge Devices ([https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24373](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24373))

    Liquid AI just dropped the LFM2.5 series, proving not every scenario needs a massive model. These bad boys are tailor-made for edge devices and local deployment. The series includes various flavors like a general text model, a Japanese-optimized version, and a vision-language model, all acing multiple benchmarks. While big models are duking it out in the clouds, these little guys are quietly taking over your phone and IoT gadgets! 📱💡

7.  Open-Source "Veo 3" Arrives: LTX-2 Supports 20-Second 4K Audio-Visual Synchronized Video Generation ([https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24373](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24373))

    LTX-2 is here, bringing an open-source 'Veo 3' vibe to the AI video generation scene! This model is a big deal, letting you pump out up to 20-second 4K HD videos with perfect audio-visual sync – all in one go! Plus, it slashes computing costs by up to 50%, meaning your local GPU can handle it. The open-source weights and code are out, so devs can tweak and deploy freely. If you're into AI video, this one's a must-bookmark! 🎬💾

8.  NextFlow: An Autoregressive Model Generating 1024×1024 Images in 5 Seconds ([https://x.com/Gorden_Sun/status/2008915000535191749](https://x.com/Gorden_Sun/status/2008915000535191749))

    ByteDance's ByteVisionLab just unveiled NextFlow, an autoregressive model based on a decoder-only Transformer that can churn out 1024-resolution images in a blazing 5 seconds! From the demo, it looks stronger than Flux Dev but still lags behind Qwen Image. No public access yet, but the paper and code are out there for everyone to check. The AI art speed race just got another level-up! 🎨💨

9.  Microsoft Announces Native MCP Protocol Support for Win11 ([https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24373](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24373))

    Microsoft just dropped some big news for developers: Windows 11 will natively support the MCP protocol! This means AI models can securely hook up with local applications. Microsoft is also rolling out 'experiential agents' that can proactively adapt and dish out personalized services. AI Agents diving deep into the OS? That's definitely the way the wind is blowing! 💻🤖

10. HP Launches World's First Keyboard AI PC ([https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24373](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24373))

    HP just blew our minds with the world's first keyboard AI PC, the Eliteboard G1a! 🤯 Stuffing an entire computer into a keyboard? It's a concept that feels both retro and futuristic. This sleek machine is only 12mm thick, weighs a mere 750 grams, and rocks an AMD Ryzen AI 300 series processor, supporting up to 64GB RAM and 2TB storage. Plus, its built-in battery gives you about 3.5 hours of juice. A new go-to for road warriors? 🤔
