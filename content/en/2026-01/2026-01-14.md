## **🔥 Top 10 Highlights**

### 1. [Google Veo 3.1 Gets a Major Upgrade: Vertical Mode + 4K Are Here](https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/2011189020211245334)

Google Veo 3.1 is here with a major upgrade, making it a joyous day for short video creators! Google's video generation model finally listened to user demands: **vertical mode is officially live**, so no more manually cropping horizontal videos for TikTok. What's even wilder? Resolution is boosted straight to 1080p and 4K, available now in Flow. Its expressive power has also been enhanced, with better fidelity to reference images. Gemini Plus/Pro/Ultra members can try it out right now. This update from Google is clearly targeting the short video market.

### 2. [Claude Code Founder Reveals: How Cowork Was Born](https://x.com/dotey/status/2011090515429614031)

Claude Code's journey from a "programmer's toy" to a "tool for everyone" is quite a story. Boris Cherny, the founder of Claude Code, shared an experience: he released a beta version in late 2024, and the very next day, his colleagues were already using it to write code. Fast forward a few months, and **data scientists, designers, finance professionals, and sales teams** were all using it—some to control ovens, others to restore wedding photos. Seizing this momentum, Anthropic launched Cowork, packaging AI Agent capabilities into a format accessible to everyday users. They say **user behavior is the best product manager**, and that couldn't be more true!

### 3. [NotebookLM Skill Upgrade: Generate Podcasts, PPTs, Mind Maps with a Single Sentence](https://x.com/vista8/status/2011028677187014891)

NotebookLM's Skill has received a massive upgrade, letting you generate podcasts, PPTs, and mind maps with a single sentence! Previously, using NotebookLM meant manually asking questions one by one. Now, with this Skill installed, you can **directly bring the entire NotebookLM to the command line**. It can also automatically interpret YouTube videos. For an even cooler trick: first ask, "What questions should I ask to cover all content?" then let it recursively ask questions, and finally write the output to Markdown. You can even summarize videos you haven't watched, getting a pretty good gist. Knowledge base interactions just got a serious level-up!

### 4. [Claude Code Skills User Guide: From Beginner to Expert](https://linux.do/t/topic/1444241)

Claude Code Skills and Commands: How do they actually work? This post explains it clearly. **Skills are intelligent, script-enabled plugins** that can be triggered automatically, while Commands are pure prompt-based workflows requiring manual invocation. User-level Skills go in `~/.claude/skills/`, and project-level ones go in the project root. Once you install skill-creator, you can have Claude Code create new Skills for you with just one sentence. There's also an mcp-builder to help you create MCP services, like connecting to MySQL. The entire ecosystem is increasingly resembling a plugin marketplace.

### 5. [OpenCode Slow Startup? How to Optimize from 29 Seconds to 3 Seconds](https://linux.do/t/topic/1443795)

OpenCode's slow startup can be a real pain, but the fix is simple: if your OpenCode takes forever to launch, the problem likely lies in your plugin configuration. The author discovered that using the `latest` version number in `package.json` caused **plugins to re-download every single time it started**. The solution is straightforward: replace `latest` with a specific version number, then run `bun install`. This slashed startup time from 29 seconds down to a snappy 3-5 seconds! As a bonus, they shared a few handy plugins: oh-my-opencode (multi-agent orchestration), opencode-antigravity-auth (using Gemini 3 Pro), and dynamic context pruning.

### 6. [Personal Workflow Open Source: 300+ Super Intelligent Development Experts + Hooks Optimization System](https://linux.do/t/topic/1443939)

This open-source personal workflow project upgrades Claude Code from a "general chat assistant" to a "professional development partner who understands your project." At its core, it uses a **Hooks system to automatically execute intelligent operations during the conversation lifecycle**: detecting project types and recommending Skills on startup, and forcing documentation updates after code modifications. It boasts 300+ built-in expert agents covering backend, frontend, testing, security, architecture, and DevOps. Running local inference with Ollama means zero-config startup. This is perfect for developers who want to push Claude Code to its limits.

### 7. [bm.md: A Markdown Editor Supporting MCP and Skills](https://x.com/op7418/status/2011073463755424065)

bm.md, a Markdown editor supporting MCP and Skills, is a godsend for WeChat Official Account layout enthusiasts! This editor is incredibly polished, with **smooth image addition and beautiful built-in themes**. Crucially, it supports MCP and Skills, allowing AI to automatically assist with formatting. The goal is to let content creators focus on writing, freeing them from the hassle of WeChat Official Account layouts. Built on TanStack Start, it's currently a preview version, so if you find issues, feel free to open an issue and let the AI fix it.

### 8. [DeepSeek Web Interface Refreshed: Smoother and More Rounded](https://linux.do/t/topic/1444275)

DeepSeek's web interface just got a sleek refresh! One day it was the old UI, then late at night, a revisit revealed a **smoother, more rounded interface**. DeepSeek quietly updated its web design, giving it a more modern overall look. While functionality remains the same, the user experience has definitely leveled up. Chinese large models are clearly paying more attention to product details.

### 9. [Claude Cowork Demystified: It's Just a 20G Linux Container + Claude Code](https://linux.do/t/topic/1444268)

Claude Cowork has been demystified! Someone dug into its underlying implementation, revealing it's essentially **a 20GB Linux container environment with AppleVM + 200MB of Claude Code**. During initialization, it downloads a rootfs.img.zst image. So, at its core, it's a re-skinned combination of existing products, no magic involved. That said, the ability to integrate these components into a user-friendly product for the average person is valuable in itself. While the tech might be demystified, its productization capability still deserves recognition.

### 10. [Google's Market Cap Soars: Only 10.5% Away from Nvidia](https://linux.do/t/topic/1444252)

Google's market cap has soared past $4 trillion, putting it just 10.5% away from surpassing Nvidia! Less than a week ago, it overtook Apple to become the world's second-most valuable company, and now it's hot on the heels of "Old Huang" (Nvidia's CEO). In the midst of the AI wave, the **search giant is redefining its value with Gemini**. Stock prices are the market's vote on the future, and it seems Wall Street is really buying into Google's AI transformation.
