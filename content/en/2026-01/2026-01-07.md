Alright, here's the deal: I've got to transform this Chinese text into killer English, and I've got a super-strict four-step plan to follow.

**First**, the "Zero-Tolerance" Rule is in effect. I need to comb through the text looking for things like `[text](URL)` and `![text](URL)`. Anything inside `[ ]`? That gets translated to English. Anything inside `( )`, whether it's a URL or a file path, stays *exactly* as it is – no changes allowed. And before I even think about moving on, I have to triple-check that I haven't messed up any brackets and that the URLs are untouched.

**Next**, it's the Primary Editorial Task. For each paragraph, I'm going to pinpoint the core idea and then rewrite the whole thing, putting that core idea front and center. I want to make it super clear and easy to understand.

**Then**, the Style Guidelines kick in. The tone needs to be super conversational, informal, and energetic. Think everyday English, maybe even a little slang. As for emojis, I gotta ditch the originals and, if needed, sprinkle in some new ones that fit the English vibe. Formatting? Gotta keep *everything* – headings, lists, code blocks, the whole shebang. Code itself stays untouched, but any comments get translated. And finally, I need to translate *all* the content, keeping the paragraph structure intact.

**Finally**, I just spit out the finished product. No introductions, no explanations, just the final, polished English version.

I'm ready. Let's do this!

### 1. [Samsung Unveils Crease-Free OLED Foldable Screen, Is Foldable iPhone Coming?](https://x.com/op7418/status/2008452185764622791)

Foldable screens, what's the biggest headache? That stubborn crease you just can't get rid of. Well, Samsung just dropped a bombshell at CES with a solution: a laser-drilled metal plate that disperses stress when folded, making the crease vanish into thin air. Even wilder, Apple's foldable iPhone might just snag this tech too. Looks like the 'wait-and-see' crowd just won big!

Musk, ever the maverick, is now building his own power plant just for computing power! He snagged five 380-megawatt natural gas turbine generators from South Korea, all to juice up his new fleet of 600,000 GB200 NVL72 units. It used to be 'money can't buy you GPUs,' but now it's 'got GPUs, but no juice.' The AI arms race has officially gone full-throttle into power infrastructure.
