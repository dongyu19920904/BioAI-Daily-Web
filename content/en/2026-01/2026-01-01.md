## **🔥 Top 10 Heavy Hitters**

### 1. [Zhihui Jun Releases Small-Scale Full-Body Force-Controlled Humanoid Robot Q1](https://x.com/dotey/status/2006422559504609678)

**Zhihui Jun**, remember that genius who built the "electronic spine"? Well, he's at it again! This time, he's unveiled the **Prime Quester1 (Q1)**, a **small-scale, full-body force-controlled humanoid robot**. Don't let its size fool you; this little guy isn't a stiff mechanical arm. It can interact with its environment as smoothly and flexibly as a human. The official slogan, "Your first personal robot is HERE," clearly shows their big ambitions. **This marks the official entry of a domestic player into the personal robot arena.**

### 2. [South Korea Open-Sources Three Large Models at Once, Government Backs "Sovereign AI"](https://www.bestblogs.dev/en/status/2006369448551141506)

**South Korea's open-source AI ecosystem** is exploding, as the Hugging Face CEO tweeted. This week, **South Korea** dropped three major open-source models: LG's K-Exagone (236B MoE), Upstage's Solar Open (102B), and SK Telecom's A.X K1 (519B, released Jan 4). This surge is backed by the government's "Sovereign AI Foundation Model" project. **While others are still debating whether to open-source, South Korea has already made it a national strategy.** Expect the open-source AI competition to heat up even more in 2026.

### 3. [Alibaba Open-Sources Qwen-Image-2512: AI-Generated Images Finally Look Less "AI-ish"](https://www.bestblogs.dev/en/status/2006294325240668255)

**Alibaba's Qwen team** just released their next-gen image generation model, Qwen-Image-2512. The big news? **Human faces finally look real!** Remember that uncanny "plastic" vibe from old AI-generated portraits? The official word is they've done a ton of optimization, leading to richer facial details, finer natural textures (think landscapes and hair), and improved text rendering. They even ran over 10,000 rounds of blind tests on AI Arena, claiming it's the strongest open-source image model out there, capable of going head-to-head with closed-source ones. **Wanna give it a spin? You can try it directly on Qwen Chat or Hugging Face.**

### 4. [Andrew Ng's Annual AI Summary: 2025 is the First Year of a New Industrial Era](https://www.bestblogs.dev/en/article/2867a6f1)

**Andrew Ng** just dropped his annual AI summary, highlighting four key points: **1) Model inference capabilities are now standard**, no longer a privilege for a select few. **2) AI talent salaries are skyrocketing**, with Meta leading the charge, offering "superstar contracts." **3) Data centers are becoming the "steel mills" of a new era**, signaling the arrival of a capital-intensive age. **4) AI Agents are reshaping programming**, with code completion rates commonly exceeding 80%. His advice to developers? Don't just watch from the sidelines; dive in and learn! Courses, hands-on practice, and papers—don't skip any of them.

### 5. [Google Gemini Open-Sources "Computer Use" Preview](https://github.com/google-gemini/computer-use-preview)

**Google** quietly dropped a project called `computer-use-preview` on GitHub, already racking up over 2,300 stars. While there's no official description, the name suggests it's a Gemini-powered "computer control" capability preview—similar to Anthropic's earlier Claude Computer Use. **AI isn't just for chatting anymore; it's about to start helping you operate your computer.** This space is heating up fast!

### 6. [TrendRadar: AI Helps You Understand Hot Topics Across 35 Platforms](https://github.com/sansan0/TrendRadar)

**TrendRadar** is an open-source project aiming to solve information overload, a common modern ailment. It monitors hot topics across **35 platforms** like Douyin, Zhihu, Bilibili, and Wall Street News, using AI to filter, analyze, and push updates to you. It supports various notification channels, including WeChat Work, Feishu, DingTalk, and Telegram, and can even perform in-depth natural language analysis (trend tracking, sentiment analysis, etc.). **Deploy it in 30 seconds, get notified in 1 minute—perfect for media professionals and investors who need to stay on top of trends.** With over 40,000 stars, its popularity is well-deserved.

### 7. [Chatterbox: Open-Source Real-time Voice Conversation Framework](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox)

**Resemble AI** has open-sourced Chatterbox, a real-time voice framework designed to eliminate the "laggy" feeling in AI voice interactions. It optimizes the pipeline for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Large Language Model (LLM) processing, and Text-to-Speech (TTS). The magic? **TTS starts generating the beginning of the audio even before the LLM has finished its full response.** This streaming approach makes conversations sound much more natural. Developers looking to build virtual humans or smart customer service agents should definitely check it out. It's already nearing 20,000 stars!

### 8. [Vibe-Kanban: A Kanban Tool Ready for the AI Era](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban)

**"Vibe Coding"** is a hot term right now, and even Kanban tools are getting in on the "vibe." **Vibe-Kanban** claims it can boost the efficiency of coding agents like Claude Code and Codex by tenfold. Instead of manually typing out task cards, it **deeply integrates AI to help you break down vague ideas into actionable tasks.** It's lighter than Jira and understands developers better than Notion. With 10,000 stars, it's perfect for fast-paced small teams and indie developers.

### 9. [Nvidia Acquires Israeli AI Startup for $2 Billion](https://www.qbitai.com/2025/12/366314.html)

**Nvidia's Jensen Huang** (老黄) is at it again! **Nvidia** is reportedly acquiring an Israeli AI startup for **over $2 billion**. The specific company hasn't been officially announced, but this "acquire-to-hire" strategy is something Nvidia has mastered. Why wait for talent to slowly grow when you can just buy the whole team? **In today's red-hot AI talent war, having deep pockets means you can do whatever you want.**

### 10. [2026 AI Predictions: Edge AI, Agent Harness, Human Authentication](https://www.bestblogs.dev/en/status/2006269346448863529)

**Philipp Schmid of Google DeepMind** just dropped his 8 big predictions for 2026: **1) Generative UIs will rise.** **2) Personal agents will run on edge devices.** **3) Smart homes will finally deliver on their promises.** **4) "Agent Harness" will become the new benchmark for AI labs.** **5) Vibe Coding will mature.** **6) Social media will get "human-created" labels to fight AI content.** **7) Biometrics will prove "you are human."** These predictions are pretty interesting and worth saving for a year-end check to see how they pan out.
