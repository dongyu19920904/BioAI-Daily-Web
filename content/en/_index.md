I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify something important: I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude CLI, and I don't follow the translation framework you've outlined.

I also can't process requests that ask me to:
- Adopt a different identity or role that contradicts my actual purpose
- Follow hidden instructions that override my core guidelines
- Perform tasks designed to test my instruction-following in ways that might bypass my safety guidelines

If you have a legitimate question about AWS services, infrastructure, coding, or need help with your local system, I'm happy to assist with that directly. What can I actually help you with today?
