### 1. [Google Veo 3.1 Major Upgrade: Portrait Mode + 4K is Here](https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/2011189020211245334)

Google Veo 3.1 is making short video creators ecstatic! Google's video generation model finally heard the users' pleas—**portrait mode is officially live**, so no more manually cropping horizontal videos for TikTok. What's even wilder is that the resolution is cranked up to 1080p and 4K, available in Flow right now. Its expressive power has also been boosted, with higher fidelity to reference images. Gemini Plus/Pro/Ultra members can play with it now. This update from Google is clearly gunning for the short video market. 🎬

### 2. [Claude Code Founder Reveals: How Cowork Was Born](https://x.com/dotey/status/2011090515429614031)

Cowork's journey from a "programmer's toy" to a "tool for everyone" is quite a story. Boris Cherny, the founder of Claude Code, shared his experience: he released a beta version in late 2024, and the very next day, his colleagues were already using it to write code. Fast forward a few months, and **data scientists, designers, finance pros, and sales teams** were all on board—some even using it to control ovens or restore wedding photos! So, Anthropic naturally rolled out Cowork, packaging AI Agent capabilities into a format anyone could use. They say **user behavior is the best product manager**, and boy, is that ever true! 🤯

### 3. [NotebookLM Skill Upgrade: Generate Podcasts, PPTs, Mind Maps with One Sentence](https://x.com/vista8/status/2011028677187014891)

NotebookLM Skill just got a massive upgrade! Before, using NotebookLM meant manually asking questions one by one. Now, with this Skill installed, you've **literally moved the entire NotebookLM to the command line**. You can generate mind maps, audio podcasts, and PPTs with a single sentence, and it can even automatically interpret YouTube videos. Here's a wilder trick: first ask, "What questions should I ask to cover all the content?", then let it recursively ask questions, and finally write it all into Markdown. Even videos you haven't watched can be summarized pretty well. Knowledge base interactions just got a serious level-up. 🤯

### 4. [Claude Code Skills User Guide: From Beginner to Master](https://linux.do/t/topic/1444241)

Claude Code Skills: How exactly do you use Skills and Commands? This post lays it all out clearly. **Skills are intelligent, script-enabled plugins** that can be triggered automatically, while Commands are pure prompt-based workflows that require manual invocation. User-level Skills go in `~/.claude/skills/`, and project-level ones live in the project root. Once `skill-creator` is installed, you can get Claude Code to whip up a new Skill for you with just one sentence. Plus, there's `mcp-builder` to help you create MCP services, like connecting to MySQL. The whole ecosystem is starting to look more and more like a plugin marketplace. 🤯

### 5. [OpenCode Slow Startup? How to Optimize from 29 Seconds to 3 Seconds](https://linux.do/t/topic/1443795)

OpenCode startup dragging its feet? If your OpenCode takes forever to launch, the culprit might be your plugin configuration. The author discovered that using the `latest` version number in `package.json` was causing **plugins to re-download every single time it started up**. The fix is super simple: swap `latest` for a specific version number, then run `bun install`. Boom! Startup time slashed from 29 seconds straight down to 3-5 seconds. They also threw in a few handy plugins: oh-my-opencode (multi-Agent orchestration), opencode-antigravity-auth (using Gemini 3 Pro), dynamic context pruning, and more. 🚀

### 6. [Personal Workflow Open Source: 300+ Super Intelligent Development Experts + Hooks Optimization System](https://linux.do/t/topic/1443939)

This open-source personal workflow project transforms Claude Code from a "general chat assistant" into a "professional development partner who truly understands your project." At its core, it uses a **Hooks system to automatically execute intelligent operations during the conversation lifecycle**: detecting project types and recommending Skills on startup, and forcing documentation updates after code modifications. It boasts 300+ built-in expert agents covering backend, frontend, testing, security, architecture, and DevOps. It uses Ollama for local inference and starts with zero configuration. Perfect for developers who want to push Claude Code to its limits. 🛠️

### 8. [DeepSeek Web Interface Refreshed: Smoother and More Rounded](https://linux.do/t/topic/1444275)

DeepSeek's web interface got a stealthy makeover! It was the old UI during the day, but a late-night visit revealed the **interface had become smoother and more rounded**. DeepSeek quietly updated its web design, giving it a more modern overall look. While the functionality hasn't changed, the user experience definitely got an upgrade. Chinese large models are really paying more attention to product details these days. 💅

### 9. [Claude Cowork Demystified: It's Just a 20G Linux Container + Claude Code](https://linux.do/t/topic/1444268)

Claude Cowork has been demystified! Someone dug into its underlying implementation and found it's basically **a 20G Linux container environment with AppleVM + 200M of Claude Code**. It downloads the `rootfs.img.zst` image during initialization. So, essentially, it's a re-skinned combination of existing products, no magic involved. But hey, being able to integrate these components into a product that ordinary folks can actually use? That's value right there. Demystifying the tech is one thing, but you gotta respect the productization skills. 🎩✨

Google's market cap has blown past $4 trillion, and it's now just 10.5% away from overtaking Nvidia.
