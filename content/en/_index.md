## **🔥 Top 10 Headlines**

### 1. [Generative AI Makes RNA Aptamer "Single-Round Evolution" a Reality](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-026-03008-4)

Traditionally, screening RNA aptamers—molecular tools that precisely recognize targets—takes months of iterative cycles. Now, a research team developed GRAPE-LM, a generative AI based on nucleic acid language models that directly predicts high-affinity sequences. In practice, a single round of experiments yields usable aptamers. For teams doing molecular diagnostics and targeted delivery, this means R&D cycles could compress to one-tenth of the original timeline.

### 2. [Nature Subjournal: Training Neural Imaging Models Directly from Hospital Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01608-0)

Previously, training medical imaging AI meant either using public datasets (limited samples) or investing heavily in cleaning hospital data. This research trains neural imaging models directly on real healthcare system-level data, proving that "messy data" can produce solid models. For hospital IT departments and AI teams, this signals: stop waiting for perfect datasets—the data you have on hand works.

### 3. [Graph Neural Networks Predict Intracranial Aneurysm Hemodynamics in Real Time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-026-02404-z)

Assessing rupture risk in intracranial aneurysms traditionally requires hours of fluid simulation. This physics-constrained graph neural network compresses prediction time to real-time speeds while maintaining physical consistency. Neurosurgeons finally won't have to wait around for simulation results during preoperative assessments.

### 4. [Graph Transformer Identifies Spatial Single-Cell Interactions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-026-01191-2)

Spatial transcriptomics data keeps piling up, but how cells actually "talk" to each other has remained a black box. This Graph Transformer model extracts cell-cell interaction relationships from spatial location and expression profiles. If you're researching tumor microenvironments or immune infiltration, keep an eye on this.

### 5. [Weakly Supervised Transformer Diagnoses Rare Diseases from Electronic Health Records](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-026-02406-x)

Rare disease diagnosis is tough—few samples, expensive annotations. This weakly supervised Transformer needs only minimal labels to identify rare disease subtypes from EHRs; the paper validates it on pulmonary diseases. For rare disease researchers, this could be a low-cost entry point.

### 6. [xGNN4MI: Explainable Graph Neural Network Decodes 12-Lead ECGs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-026-02367-1)

ECG AI diagnostics aren't new, but doctors hate "black boxes." xGNN4MI not only classifies cardiovascular diseases—it tells you which leads and waveforms the model is looking at. Explainability finally caught up with accuracy.

### 7. [AI-Driven 3D Subcellular RPE Atlas Reveals Polarity Establishment Process](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44387-026-00074-6)

Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell polarity establishment has been a hot topic in ophthalmology research. This AI system automatically constructs 3D subcellular atlases, uncovering key nodes in cell state transitions. If you're working on ocular regenerative medicine, dig deeper.

### 8. [ConvAHKG: Dual-Channel Convolutional Knowledge Graph Enables Drug Repurposing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-026-38656-8)

Drug repurposing (old drugs, new uses) is a hot AI pharma track. This method combines action-level knowledge graphs with dual-channel convolution to unearth novel drug-disease associations. Another pipeline worth trying for drug discovery teams.

### 9. [DiReG: Navigation Map for Direct Cell Reprogramming](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-026-00652-z)

Want to turn skin cells into neurons? Direct reprogramming is one route, but the roadmap has always been fuzzy. DiReG integrates massive reprogramming data to help you plan the optimal conversion path. Useful reference for cell therapy and regenerative medicine teams.

### 10. [SimCardioNet: Hybrid Learning Framework Auto-Classifies ECGs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-026-36932-1)

Another ECG classification model, but this time it's a hybrid learning framework balancing accuracy and generalization. If you're building cardiac AI products, compare it against your own model's performance.
