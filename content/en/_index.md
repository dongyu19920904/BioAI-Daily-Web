## **🔥 Top 10 Highlights**

### 1. [Google Launches "Personal Intelligence": Gemini Finally Gets You](https://x.com/demishassabis/status/2011548547917783154)

Used to ask AI "where should I go next week?" and get a wild guess. Not anymore. DeepMind's chief Demis Hassabis just announced: Gemini can now safely connect to your Gmail, Google Photos, and search history (with your permission) to give you advice that actually *gets* you. For example, it can plan your trip based on flight dates in your emails and your interests from your photo library. This isn't generic AI—it's **your** AI. Privacy advocates might raise an eyebrow, but this is a major leap for digital assistants.

### 2. [Open-Wearables: Unify All Your Wearable Device Health Data in One Place](https://github.com/the-momentum/open-wearables)

One app for your fitness band, another for your smartwatch, yet another for your body fat scale—data scattered everywhere, right? Open-Wearables is a self-hosted platform that consolidates all your wearable health data into one AI-ready API. Developers are thrilled. Want to use AI to analyze your sleep, heart rate, and workout data? This open-source project connects all the dots. 340 stars and climbing—worth watching.

---

### 3. [WellAlly-Health: Claude-Powered Intelligent Health Assistant](https://github.com/huifer/WellAlly-health)

Log symptoms, manage medications, track medical records, get multidisciplinary analysis—stuff that used to require multiple hospital visits. WellAlly-Health combines Claude AI with medical expertise to handle it all through natural language conversation. 580 stars, open-source and self-deployable. Perfect for individuals and small teams looking to "smartify" their health management. Fair warning though: AI suggestions are for reference only—don't treat it as your doctor.

---

### 4. [OpenHealth: 3700+ Star Open-Source AI Health Assistant](https://github.com/OpenHealthForAll/open-health)

Another "your data, your rules" project. OpenHealth lets you train an AI assistant on your own health data, completely local, zero cloud uploads. 3,784 stars with an active community. Ideal for privacy-obsessed users who still want AI-powered health management. The catch? You'll need some technical chops—beginners might need to tinker a bit.

---

### 5. [Awesome-AI-Agents-for-Healthcare: Your Go-To Resource for Medical AI Agents](https://github.com/AgenticHealthAI/Awesome-AI-Agents-for-Healthcare)

Want to stay on top of AI Agents in healthcare? This GitHub repo has you covered. Papers, projects, frameworks, applications—400 stars of curated resources perfect for researchers, product managers, and investors to get up to speed fast. Bookmark it and actually read it this time.

---

### 6. [DeepPurpose: Deep Learning Toolkit for Drug-Target Prediction](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose)

If you're in AI pharma, you've probably heard of this one. DeepPurpose is a specialized deep learning toolkit for drug-target interaction (DTI), drug properties, and protein function prediction. 1,116 stars, actively maintained. Need to quickly spin up a DTI prediction model? This library saves you tons of wheel-reinventing time.

---

### 7. [HealthChain: The "Middleware" Healthcare AI Needed](https://github.com/dotimplement/HealthChain)

What's the biggest headache in healthcare AI development? Inconsistent data formats, fragmented interfaces, complex compliance requirements. HealthChain calls itself "the missing middleware layer for healthcare AI," handling all the messy stuff for you. 174 stars—young project, but the direction is spot-on. Healthcare AI product teams should keep tabs on this.

---

### 8. [MAProt: Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Protein Design](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.13.699365v1?rss=1)

The classic protein design dilemma: structural stability and functional performance rarely play nice together. MAProt tackles this with multi-agent reinforcement learning—one Agent handles structure (ProteinMPNN), another handles function (ESM/SaProt), and Pareto optimization lets them "negotiate" the best solution. Experiments show it outperforms existing methods in thermal stability, functional proteins, and high-affinity antibody design. AI pharma folks, this paper is a must-read.

### 9. [Boltz-2 Crushes Other Methods in Virtual Screening](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.14.699425v1?rss=1)

Virtual screening (finding potential drugs from millions of compounds) is the battleground of AI pharma. This preprint tested Boltz-2 on ten massive screening datasets—result: twice the success rate of other methods. Plus it's simple to classify, efficient, robust, and runs on standard hardware for million-scale compound ranking. Another major step forward in AI pharma infrastructure.

---

### 10. [Foundation Model for Continuous Glucose Monitoring Is Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09925-9)

Great news for diabetics. Nature just published a foundation model specifically designed for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. Previously, CGM analysis relied on rules or small models—now with large model power, blood sugar prediction, anomaly detection, and personalized recommendations are way more accurate. This is a major milestone in AI + chronic disease management.
