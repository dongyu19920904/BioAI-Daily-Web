## **🔥 Top 10 Headlines**

### 1. [De novo design of potent CRISPR–Cas13 inhibitors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-025-02136-3)

Gene editing just got a new player. Researchers used AI to design potent CRISPR-Cas13 inhibitors from scratch—and here's why it matters: we used to only be able to "turn on" gene editing, but now we finally have a precise "off switch." This is huge for gene therapy safety, bringing clinical applications one step closer.

### 2. [Modelling drug-induced cellular perturbation responses with a biologically informed dual-branch transformer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01165-w)

What happens when a drug enters a cell? We used to figure that out through slow, tedious experiments. Now this dual-branch Transformer model feeds biological knowledge directly into AI to predict how drugs perturb cells. For AI drug discovery, it's like giving drug screening an "X-ray vision."

---

### 3. [Computational design of generalist cyclopropanases with stereodivergent selectivity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68327-1)

Great news for enzyme engineers. A research team used computational methods to design "generalist" cyclopropanases that can precisely control the stereochemistry of products. In plain English: synthesizing certain drug molecules used to be a gamble, but now AI helps you hit the bullseye every time.

---

### 4. [Multimodal digital biopsy for preoperative prediction of occult peritoneal metastasis in gastric cancer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-02268-9)

What's the biggest fear before gastric cancer surgery? Missed peritoneal metastasis. This study uses multimodal AI for "digital biopsy" to predict occult peritoneal metastasis before surgery. For surgeons, this could change surgical decisions; for patients, avoiding one unnecessary surgery is a win.

---

### 5. [Algorithmic antibiotic decision-making in urinary tract infection using prescriber-informed prediction of treatment utility](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-026-02369-z)

Antibiotic overuse is a global headache. This algorithm combines doctor prescribing patterns to predict the best treatment for urinary tract infections. It's not replacing doctors—it's giving them a "second opinion." Precise medication use, less resistance, this is what AI healthcare should look like.

### 6. [The future of mathematical oncology in the age of AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-026-00656-9)

What happens when oncology meets AI? This review lays out the roadmap: from mathematical modeling to AI prediction, cancer treatment is moving from "empirical medicine" to "precision medicine." If you want to understand the future of AI oncology, this is a must-read.

## **😄 AI Life Sciences Fun Fact**

### [AI Creativity Showdown: 100,000 Humans vs GPT-4—Results Are Surprising](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125083356.htm)

Researchers pitted GPT-4 against 100,000 people in a creativity contest, and AI beat the "average person." But don't panic—the top 10% of creative humans? AI still can't touch them. Especially when it comes to poetry and storytelling, AI falls short. So if you're average, maybe worry a bit; if you're a genius, keep chilling. 😂
