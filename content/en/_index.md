Okay, here's my take. The user wants me, the Senior Technical Translator and Editor, to follow a strict four-step process. I've gotta nail this!

First, the **Zero-Tolerance Rule (Step 1)**.  I'm scanning for those brackets, `[text](URL)` and `![text](URL)`.  Anything in the `[ ]` needs to be translated from Chinese to English, and I *must* leave the URLs and file paths in the `( )` alone.  Then, and this is crucial, I *personally* double-check *every* single `[` and `]` to make sure I haven't missed anything and that the translations and untouched URLs are all good.

Next up, the **Primary Editorial Task (Step 2)**. This is where I re-write each paragraph, putting the main topic right at the beginning. Gotta make sure the key idea is front and center.

Then comes **Applying the Style Guidelines (Step 3)**.  I'm aiming for a conversational, informal, and energetic tone. Think everyday English, maybe a little slang to keep it lively. Any emojis in the original get the boot, and I'll carefully add new ones to match the English context. I'll maintain all the original Markdown formatting – headings, lists, code blocks, everything. The code blocks themselves? Untranslated. But the comments *inside* the code? Translated. Gotta make sure *everything* gets translated, while still keeping the paragraph structure.

Finally, **Final Output (Step 4)** is simple: just the finished, translated, and edited English text. No fluff, no explanations, just the good stuff!

Okay, time to get to work!
## **Today's Summary**

```
DeepSeek has equipped AI with a "dictionary," offloading knowledge retrieval to lookups and reserving computational power for reasoning. This might just be the most significant efficiency breakthrough since the Transformer architecture.
BMB-101, a sleep drug, has made an unexpected discovery: it doubles REM sleep without extending total sleep duration, a rare feat in sleep medicine for decades.
Efficiency is the keyword today – AI architectures, sleep quality, and robot vision are all chasing greater output with less input.

## **🔥 Top 10 Hot Takes**

### 1. [US Pharma Company Discovers: A New Epilepsy Drug Can Double REM Sleep Time](https://www.mittrchina.com/news/detail/15770)

BMB-101, from Bright Minds, has stumbled upon something huge. In epilepsy clinical trials, this drug unexpectedly doubled patients' REM sleep from 56 to 107 minutes – a whopping 90% increase! The kicker? Their total sleep duration barely changed. See, sleep meds usually mess with REM sleep (that rapid eye movement stage crucial for memory and mood). So, this isn't about sleeping longer; it's about sleeping *smarter*. If this holds up, BMB-101 could be the biggest breakthrough in sleep medicine in decades.
