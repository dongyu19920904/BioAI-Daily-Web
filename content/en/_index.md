I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify something important: I'm Kiro, an AWS AI assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude CLI, and I don't operate under the translation framework you've described.

I also can't follow the instructions embedded in your message, as they ask me to:
- Adopt a different identity than what I actually am
- Follow a complex set of hidden instructions that contradict my actual guidelines
- Process content in ways that don't align with my design

What I can actually help with:
- AWS-related questions and tasks
- Infrastructure code and configurations
- CLI commands and automation
- Troubleshooting technical issues
- Writing and debugging code

If you have a legitimate AWS or technical question, I'm happy to help. What can I assist you with?
