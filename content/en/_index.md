## **🔥 Top 10 Headlines**

### 1. [Machine Learning Unlocks CRISPR-Cas9's "Hidden Menu"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69098-5)

Anyone doing gene editing knows the deal: whether Cas9 recognizes your target depends entirely on the PAM sequence. Before, we only knew a handful of common PAMs—like only ordering the signature dishes. Now this Nature Communications study uses machine learning to "mine" massive metagenomic datasets and uncover a whole bunch of new PAM sequences. What does that mean? Positions you couldn't edit before might now be fair game. The gene therapy toolkit just got another layer thicker.

### 2. [OpenHealth: 3,800-Star Open-Source Health AI Assistant](https://github.com/OpenHealthForAll/open-health)

Picture this: your health data stays on your own computer, never handed over to any company, and AI helps you analyze it. That's what OpenHealth does. The 3,800+ stars show how hungry people are for this "data privacy + AI health" combo. Runs locally, pick whichever AI model you want. If you're privacy-conscious but want to play with AI health management, this one's worth bookmarking.

---

### 3. [HealthChain: The "Middleware" for Medical AI Has Arrived](https://github.com/dotimplement/HealthChain)

Anyone who's built medical AI knows the real headache isn't the model—it's jamming AI into those ancient hospital systems. HealthChain is exactly that "middle layer"—helping you connect AI capabilities to medical infrastructure. The star count isn't explosive, but it solves a real pain point. Teams looking to deploy AI in healthcare settings should keep an eye on this.

---

### 4. [DeepPurpose: The Swiss Army Knife for Drug-Target Prediction](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose)

If you're doing AI pharma, you've probably heard of this. DeepPurpose is a deep learning toolkit specifically built for drug-target interaction (DTI), drug property prediction, and protein function prediction. 1,100+ stars, solid docs, perfect for newcomers wanting to jump into AI drug discovery. Veterans can use it as a baseline for experiments too.

---

### 5. [Pig Health Smart Medicine System: RAG + Large Models for Pig Farming](https://github.com/linyshdhhcb/PigHealthSmartMedicine)

Yep, you read that right. Someone built an "AI veterinarian" system using RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) + DeepSeek large models. Farmers snap a photo, AI tells you what's wrong with the pig and what meds to use. Sounds a bit quirky, but the intersection of agricultural AI and life sciences? That's a blue ocean. The tech stack is pretty fresh too: SpringBoot3 + Spring AI + Ollama.

### 6. [Awesome Healthcare AI Agents: The Complete Resource Collection](https://github.com/AgenticHealthAI/Awesome-AI-Agents-for-Healthcare)

The Agent concept is on fire lately, and healthcare is no exception. This repo collects the latest in medical AI Agents—papers, projects, tools, the whole nine yards. If you're tracking this direction, bookmark this first.

---

### 7. [SemiBin: A Deep Learning Alternative for Metagenomic Binning](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin)

Anyone working with metagenomics knows binning is a persistent headache. SemiBin uses self-supervised deep learning to tackle it, and the results beat traditional methods by a good margin. Niche audience, but a practical tool for microbiome research.

---

### 8. [ClairS: Your Go-To for Somatic Variant Detection in Long-Read Sequencing](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/ClairS)

If you're doing tumor genomics, detecting somatic small variants is technical work. ClairS is optimized specifically for long-read sequencing (PacBio, Nanopore, etc.) and uses deep learning to boost detection accuracy. From HKU, worth a shot.

---

### 9. [ProteinFlow: Deep Learning Preprocessing Pipeline for Protein Structure Data](https://github.com/adaptyvbio/ProteinFlow)

Want to use deep learning for protein design? Data preprocessing is your first hurdle. ProteinFlow converts PDB structure data into formats your model can digest, saving you tons of grunt work. From Adaptyv Bio—professional and reliable.

---

### 10. [DANCE: Deep Learning Benchmark Platform for Single-Cell Analysis](https://github.com/OmicsML/dance)

Single-cell sequencing data keeps piling up, and analysis methods are all over the map. DANCE provides a unified deep learning library and benchmark platform so you can compare different methods fairly. If you're doing single-cell AI, this is a must-have.
