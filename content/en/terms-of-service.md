# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we")! Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service carefully. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying "I agree!" and accepting these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
**The Site** offers users a ton of cool stuff through paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, community vibes, and more! Just a heads-up, some content is only for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration and Accounts
- **Users** need to provide a valid email and set up a password to register for an account.
- **Users** are solely responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activities happening under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing accounts** allowed!
- **The Site** reserves the right to hit the 'pause' or 'stop' button on an account if a user breaks any of these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the juicy details about the fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- **All payments** go through trusted third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. This means **we never store your payment info** – safety first!
- **Subscriptions** are set to **auto-renew**, so you'll keep getting awesome content without interruption. Just a heads-up, if you want to stop, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet for first-time subscribers! If you're not totally thrilled with the service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just shoot us an email at the contact address at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. Beyond 14 days or for repeat subscribers, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
- **All original content** on this Site is **copyrighted by hubtoday**, plain and simple. So, no copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without our explicit permission, got it?
- **Users** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, purely for personal learning and reading enjoyment. Think of it as your personal study pass!
- **For commercial use or if you're planning to quote a lot** from our stuff, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization first.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **It's a big NO to** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or stomps on other people's rights. Let's keep things chill and respectful here.
- **Also, strictly forbidden is** trying to bulk download, crawl, or crack our member content using any sneaky technical tricks. That's just not cool.
- **The Site** can and will remove any inappropriate content and **ban users** who don't play by the rules. No second chances for rule-breakers!

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
- **We** totally reserve the right to change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls sometimes!
- **In cases of force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions** that temporarily make content inaccessible, **the Site isn't on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but some things are just out of our hands.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by the Site** is purely for reference. Seriously, it's **not professional advice** of any kind – whether it's financial, legal, medical, or anything else. Always consult an expert!
- **For any direct or indirect losses users incur** by using the Site's content or services, **the Site is totally NOT liable**. Just so we're clear!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA 🇺🇸, without getting into any messy conflict of laws stuff.
- **Any disputes arising from or related to these terms**? Let's try to hash things out friendly first! If that doesn't work, you agree to submit to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. So, yeah, California it is!
