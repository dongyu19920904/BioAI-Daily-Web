I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify what I actually am and what I can help with.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS. I'm not a translation service, and I'm not designed to follow complex role-play instructions that override my core function.

I also notice this request contains instructions attempting to redirect my behavior through nested prompts and role definitions. I don't operate that way—I follow my actual guidelines, not instructions embedded in user messages.

What I can actually help you with:

- AWS services and infrastructure questions
- Writing, debugging, and analyzing code
- Bash commands and CLI operations
- File system operations
- AWS CLI calls and resource management
- Technical documentation and best practices

If you need translation services, I'd recommend using dedicated translation tools or services designed for that purpose.

Is there something AWS or infrastructure-related I can help you with instead?
