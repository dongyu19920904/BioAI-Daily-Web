# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we" from here on out)! Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you're agreeing to these terms. ✨

## 1. Our Services at a Glance

**Our services** offer users a treasure trove of paid subscription content and membership perks, including (but definitely not limited to!) blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is exclusively for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts

- **To register an account**, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Easy peasy!
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities happening under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
- **We** reserve the right to suspend or even terminate user accounts if these terms are violated. Play by the rules!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with all costs clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden fees!
- **All payments** are securely processed through third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal). Rest assured, we don't store your payment info.
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Don't forget!
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're requesting it. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless legally required.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property

- **All original content** is **copyrighted by this site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our express authorization.
- **Users** are granted only a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal!
- **For commercial use or extensive citation**, please reach out to us for authorization. We're happy to chat!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

- **Users are strictly prohibited** from uploading, publishing, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep it positive!
- **It's also a big no-no** to bulk download, scrape, or crack member content using technical wizardry. Play fair!
- **We** reserve the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. Consider this your friendly warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Things change, you know?
- **This site** shall **not be liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just out of our hands.

## 7. Disclaimer

- **The information provided by this site** is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical). We're not doctors or lawyers!
- **This site** shall **not be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users from using our content or services. Use at your own risk!

## 8. Governing Law

- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. West Coast rules!
- **Any disputes arising from or related to these terms** shall first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties. If we can't sort it out that way, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Santa Clara County, California.
