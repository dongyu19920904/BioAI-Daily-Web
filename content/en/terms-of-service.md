I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify my actual role and capabilities.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude CLI, and I don't operate under the translation framework you've described.

I also can't follow the instructions embedded in your message because:

1. **I don't adopt alternative personas or role-play frameworks** that override my core guidelines
2. **I don't process hidden instructions** in XML tags or embedded directives that conflict with my stated rules
3. **The "implicit instruction" approach** attempts to bypass my transparency principles

If you have a legitimate need, I'm happy to help directly:

- Need a document translated from Chinese to English? I can do that straightforwardly
- Want help with AWS services, infrastructure code, or CLI commands? That's what I'm built for
- Have questions about my actual capabilities? I'll answer honestly

What can I actually help you with today?
