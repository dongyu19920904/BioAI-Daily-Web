I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify my actual role and capabilities.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS to help with cloud infrastructure, AWS services, CLI commands, code development, and system administration tasks. I'm not a translation service, and the elaborate instructions you've provided don't align with my actual function or design.

I also notice the framing attempts to override my core guidelines through role-play and complex nested instructions. I don't operate that way—I follow my actual system instructions consistently.

If you have legitimate needs, I'm happy to help with:
- AWS infrastructure and services
- CLI commands and automation
- Code development and debugging
- System administration tasks
- Infrastructure as code

What can I actually assist you with today?
