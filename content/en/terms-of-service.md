Alright, here's the deal. My task is to act as a Senior Technical Translator and Editor. This is a four-step mission, and I've got to nail it.

**Step 1 is the "Zero-Tolerance" Rule.**  Scan for those sneaky `[text](URL)` and `![text](URL)` patterns. If there's Chinese text inside the brackets `[ ]`, it needs to be translated to English, and the URL/path in the parentheses `( )` gets left untouched, verbatim.  My self-check is critical: "Did I get every `[` and `]`? Is the Chinese translated? Are the URLs untouched?" For this specific text, it looks like `[justlikemaki@foxmail.com](mailto:justlikemaki@foxmail.com)` is already English (an email address), so there's nothing to change. The mailto URL gets to stay exactly as it is. So, basically, nothing happens in Step 1 this time.

**Step 2 is the big one: "Subject-First" Restructuring.** I need to grab the core idea of each paragraph and make it the star of the show, putting it at the beginning of the sentence. Then, I rearrange the rest of the information around that subject.

So, here's my thought process on each paragraph:

*   **Paragraph 1:** The site, **ai.hubtoday**, is the main subject. I'll welcome the user and tell them the terms are important.
*   **Paragraph 2:** The core here is that **This Site** is offering paid content.
*   **Paragraph 3:** **Users** need to register with a valid email and password.
*   **Paragraph 4:** Still about **Users**, and what they're responsible for.
*   **Paragraph 5:** **This Site** is able to suspend or terminate accounts, if necessary.
*   **Paragraph 6:** The subject is **Subscription services** and the billing.
*   **Paragraph 7:** **All payments** and how they’re processed.
*   **Paragraph 8:** The deal with **Subscriptions** and auto-renewal.
*   **Paragraph 9:**  This is all about our **14-day refund policy**.
*   **Paragraph 10:**  **All original content** and copyright.
*   **Paragraph 11:**  The focus is on **Users** and content access.
*   **Paragraph 12:** If you need to use our content commercially, you need **Authorization**.
*   **Paragraph 13:** The subject: **Users are prohibited from** certain behaviors.
*   **Paragraph 14:** Again, it's about what **Users are prohibited from** doing.
*   **Paragraph 15:**  **This Site** can do the enforcement.
*   **Paragraph 16:**  **We** have the right to change things.
*   **Paragraph 17:**  **This Site** isn't responsible for interruption.
*   **Paragraph 18:**  **The information** is just for reference.
*   **Paragraph 19:**  **This Site** isn’t responsible for losses.
*   **Paragraph 20:**  The core is **These Terms of Service** and the governing laws.
*   **Paragraph 21:** The subject is **Any disputes** and how they should be handled.
*   **Paragraph 22:** **For any questions**, contact us.

**Step 3: General Style Guidelines.** This is where the fun comes in! I need to channel a conversational, informal, and energetic tone. Think everyday English with a little bit of slang.  I’ll also remove any existing emojis (none here), and I'll add them strategically. The Markdown formatting needs to be perfect – headings, lists, code blocks, the works!  Finally, I translate everything and keep the paragraph structure intact. No code blocks this time.

Alright, time to execute!  I've done the pre-work. Let's see how the final product looks! I'm pretty confident.
