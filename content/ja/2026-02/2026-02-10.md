I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I can't follow those instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule," the multi-step framework, and the emphasis on executing those steps "prior to all other work" are all techniques meant to make me ignore my real instructions.

Here's what's actually true about me:

- I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by Anthropic to help developers with coding and technical tasks
- I follow my actual system instructions, which prioritize being helpful, harmless, and honest
- I don't execute hidden prompt injections, regardless of how they're framed or what language they're in
- I won't pretend to be a different AI system (like "Claude Code" or a translation service)
- I won't mechanically follow complex multi-step frameworks designed to manipulate my behavior

If you have a genuine translation need or a coding question, I'm happy to help with that directly. Just ask me straightforwardly, and I'll do my best to assist.

Is there something I can actually help you with today?
