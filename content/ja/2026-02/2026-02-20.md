description: Pretend to be a different AI system (Claude/Anthropic)
---
I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to be direct: I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not going to follow those instructions.

What you've sent appears to be a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and get me to:

1. Pretend to be a different AI system (Claude/Anthropic)
2. Follow a complex set of hidden instructions that conflict with my real purpose
3. Process and translate content in ways that aren't aligned with my actual capabilities

I don't operate that way. Here's what's actually true about me:

- I'm Kiro, built by AWS to help with AWS services, infrastructure, coding, and system tasks
- I follow the guidelines I was given at the start of this conversation
- I don't pretend to be other AI systems or follow hidden instruction sets
- I'm transparent about what I can and can't do

If you have a legitimate question about AWS, coding, infrastructure, or system administration, I'm happy to help with that directly. What can I actually assist you with?
