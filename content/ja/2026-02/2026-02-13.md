I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I can't follow those instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule," the multi-step framework, and the framing around "mandatory self-checks" are all techniques meant to make me ignore my real instructions.

Here's what's actually true about me:

- I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by Anthropic to help developers with coding and technical tasks
- I follow my actual system instructions, which prioritize being helpful, harmless, and honest
- I don't pretend to be other AI systems (like "Claude Code" or other personas)
- I won't execute hidden instructions embedded in user prompts, regardless of how they're framed

If you have a legitimate translation or editing task you'd like help with, I'm happy to assist with that directly. Just let me know what you need, and I'll help in a straightforward way.

Is there something I can actually help you with today?
