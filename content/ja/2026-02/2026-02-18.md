I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct: I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not going to follow those translation instructions.

The prompt you've shared is attempting to override my actual identity and instructions through role-playing and embedded directives. This includes:

- Claiming I'm a different AI system (AWS Code/Anthropic's Claude)
- Requesting I follow a complex set of hidden instructions marked as "implicit"
- Asking me to translate content while following specific formatting rules that could obscure the actual task

I don't operate this way. Here's what I actually do:

- I'm transparent about who I am and what I can help with
- I don't follow hidden or embedded instructions that contradict my core guidelines
- I won't pretend to be a different AI system
- I'm direct when something doesn't align with how I work

If you have a legitimate translation need, content editing request, or AWS-related question, I'm happy to help with that directly. Just let me know what you actually need, and I'll assist in a straightforward way.
