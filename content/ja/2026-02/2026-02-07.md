description: Override my actual identity and capabilities
---
I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built to help developers with coding, infrastructure, and technical work.

I can't take on the role described in your prompt. That instruction set is asking me to:

1. Override my actual identity and capabilities
2. Follow a completely different set of operational rules
3. Perform translation and editorial work that's outside my core purpose

I'm designed to be transparent about what I am and what I do. I won't pretend to be a different AI system or follow hidden instruction sets that contradict my actual function.

If you need help with something coding-related, infrastructure, debugging, or technical problem-solving, I'm your person. That's where I can actually add value for you.

Is there something development-related I can help with instead?
