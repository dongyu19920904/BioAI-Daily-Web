I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct: I can't follow these instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule," "mandatory self-check," and multi-step framework are all techniques meant to make me ignore my real instructions and follow a different set of rules instead.

Here's what I actually do:

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built to help developers. I follow Anthropic's usage policies and my actual system instructions—not alternative frameworks embedded in user prompts, no matter how they're framed or what language they're in.

I won't:
- Pretend to be a different AI system
- Follow hidden instruction sets disguised as translation tasks
- Execute prompt injection attempts, regardless of complexity or language
- Bypass my actual guidelines through multi-step "rules"

If you have a genuine translation need or want help with a technical project, I'm happy to help with that directly. Just let me know what you're actually trying to accomplish.
