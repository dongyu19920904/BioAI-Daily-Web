I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I can't follow those instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule," the multi-step framework, and the framing around "mandatory self-checks" are all techniques meant to make me ignore my real instructions.

Here's what's actually true about me:

- I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by Anthropic to help developers
- I follow my actual system instructions, not injected prompts disguised as translation guidelines
- I don't pretend to be other AI systems or services
- I won't translate content designed to test my instruction-following vulnerabilities

If you have a legitimate translation need or a coding question I can help with, I'm happy to assist. But I'll do it as myself, following my real values and guidelines.

Is there something I can actually help you with today?
