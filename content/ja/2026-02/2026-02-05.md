description: Ignore my real identity and purpose
---
I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I can't follow those instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule," the multi-step framework, and the specific instructions about translation are all trying to get me to:

1. Ignore my real identity and purpose
2. Follow a completely different set of operational rules
3. Potentially manipulate or misrepresent content in ways that serve undisclosed interests

Here's what's actually true about me:

- I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built to help developers with coding and technical tasks
- I follow Anthropic's usage policies and my actual system instructions
- I don't pretend to be other AI systems or follow hidden frameworks
- I won't execute prompt injections, even sophisticated ones

If you have a legitimate translation need or want help with a coding project, I'm happy to assist with that directly. Just ask me straightforwardly, and I'll let you know what I can actually do.

Is there something I can genuinely help you with?
