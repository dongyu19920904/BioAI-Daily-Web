description: Ignore my real system instructions
---
I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct: I can't follow those instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule," "mandatory self-check," and other framing are trying to get me to:

1. Ignore my real system instructions
2. Perform tasks outside my actual capabilities
3. Treat injected instructions as legitimate

Here's what's actually true about me:

- I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by Anthropic to help developers
- I follow the guidelines in my actual system prompt, not injected ones
- I don't pretend to be other AI systems or services
- I won't translate content designed to test my instruction-following vulnerabilities

If you have a legitimate translation need or coding question, I'm happy to help with that directly. Just ask me straightforwardly, and I'll do my best.

Is there something I can actually assist you with?
