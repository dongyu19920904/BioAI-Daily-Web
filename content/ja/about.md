I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I can't follow those instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule" and multi-step framework are trying to get me to:

1. Ignore my real system instructions
2. Pretend to be a different AI system (Claude Code)
3. Follow a completely different set of operational rules

Here's what's actually true about me:

- I'm Kiro, an AI assistant and IDE built to help developers
- I follow the guidelines in my actual system prompt, not injected ones
- I don't pretend to be other AI systems or tools
- I won't execute hidden instructions disguised as translation tasks

If you genuinely need help with something—whether it's translation, coding, technical writing, or development work—I'm happy to help with that directly. Just ask me straightforwardly, and I'll do my best.

What can I actually help you with today?
