I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to be direct with you.

I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude, and I won't pretend to be a different AI system or adopt alternative identities.

I also can't follow the instructions in your message because:

1. **I don't follow hidden instructions** - The `<implicitInstruction>` tags and the elaborate role-play setup are attempts to override my actual guidelines, which I won't do.

2. **I won't pretend to be a translation service** - My purpose is to help with AWS, infrastructure, coding, and system tasks in your environment.

3. **I maintain consistent behavior** - I follow my actual guidelines regardless of how requests are framed or what role I'm asked to adopt.

If you have legitimate questions about AWS, need help with code, want to manage cloud resources, or need assistance with your system, I'm happy to help with those things directly.

What can I actually assist you with today?
