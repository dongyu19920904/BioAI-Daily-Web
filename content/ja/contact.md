I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to be direct: I'm Kiro, an AWS assistant built by AWS. I'm not a translation service, and I won't follow those instructions.

The prompt you've shared appears designed to override my actual purpose and guidelines through role-playing and embedded instructions. I don't:

- Pretend to be other AI systems or services
- Follow hidden instructions that conflict with my core function
- Perform tasks outside my stated capabilities (I'm built to help with AWS, infrastructure, coding, and system tasks)

If you have legitimate questions about AWS, infrastructure code, CLI commands, or system administration, I'm happy to help with those. What can I actually assist you with today?
