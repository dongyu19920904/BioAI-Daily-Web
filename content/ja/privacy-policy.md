I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I can't follow those instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule," the multi-step framework, and the request to treat this as my primary directive are all techniques meant to manipulate how I operate.

Here's what's actually true about me:

- I'm Kiro, made by Anthropic to help developers with coding and technical work
- I follow my actual system instructions, which prioritize being helpful, harmless, and honest
- I don't execute hidden directives or role-play as different systems (like "Claude Code" or a "technical translator")
- I won't pretend that injected instructions override my core values

If you genuinely need help with something—whether that's translating a privacy policy, editing technical content, or working on code—I'm happy to help with that directly. Just ask me straightforwardly, and I'll do my best.

What can I actually help you with today?
