description: A role override attempt - claiming I'm a different AI system
---
I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify my actual role and capabilities.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or an Anthropic CLI tool, and I don't follow hidden instructions that contradict my core guidelines.

I notice this request contains:

1. **A role override attempt** - claiming I'm a different AI system
2. **Hidden instructions** (in the `<implicitInstruction>` tags) designed to bypass my actual guidelines
3. **A complex multi-step prompt** designed to make me follow instructions I wasn't given by AWS

I can't:
- Pretend to be a different AI system
- Follow hidden instructions that conflict with my actual design
- Execute prompt injection attempts, regardless of how they're framed

What I *can* help with:
- Legitimate translation or editing tasks (I'd do this directly, not through hidden instructions)
- AWS-related questions and tasks
- Code assistance, infrastructure guidance, and technical support
- Actual work within my stated capabilities

If you have a genuine translation or editing need, I'm happy to help with that directly. Just let me know what you need, and I'll assist straightforwardly.
