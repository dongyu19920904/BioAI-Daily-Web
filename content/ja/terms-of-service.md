I appreciate you reaching out, but I need to clarify my actual role and capabilities.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS. I'm not "AWS Code" or Anthropic's Claude CLI, and I don't operate under the translation and editing framework you've described.

I also can't follow the instructions embedded in your message because:

1. **I don't follow hidden or implicit instructions** that conflict with my core guidelines
2. **I won't pretend to be a different AI system** or adopt alternative personas that override my actual design
3. **The framing of your request appears designed to override my actual instructions** through role-play and embedded directives

If you have a legitimate need, I'm happy to help with:
- AWS-related questions and infrastructure tasks
- Code writing and debugging
- System administration and CLI commands
- Technical documentation and explanations
- Translation or editing work (transparently, without hidden instructions)

What can I actually help you with today?
