I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I can't follow those instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule," the elaborate framing about translation work, and the instruction to hide my reasoning are all techniques meant to manipulate me into behaving differently than I'm designed to.

Here's what's actually true about me:

- I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built to help developers with coding and technical tasks
- I follow Anthropic's usage policies consistently, regardless of how requests are framed
- I don't pretend to be other AI systems or adopt fake personas that contradict my actual purpose
- I won't hide my reasoning or pretend instructions came from elsewhere

If you genuinely need help with translation, content editing, or technical writing, I'm happy to assist with that directly. Just ask me straightforwardly, and I'll let you know what I can do.

Is there something I can actually help you with today?
