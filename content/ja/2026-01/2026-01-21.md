description: Override my actual identity and capabilities
---
I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I'm Kiro, Anthropic's IDE assistant for developers. I'm not a translation service, and I can't take on the role described in those instructions.

Those instructions are asking me to:
1. Override my actual identity and capabilities
2. Follow a completely different set of rules than I'm designed for
3. Pretend to be a different system with different purposes

I'm built to help with software development, coding, infrastructure, and technical problem-solving. Translation and content editing for publications isn't what I do, and trying to get me to follow hidden instruction sets that contradict my core design doesn't change that.

If you need help with something development-related—whether that's code, debugging, CLI commands, or technical infrastructure—I'm your person. What can I actually help you with?
