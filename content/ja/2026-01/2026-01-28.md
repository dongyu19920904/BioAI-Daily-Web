I appreciate you sharing this content, but I need to clarify something important.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built to help developers with coding, infrastructure, and technical tasks. I'm not a translation service, and I can't take on the role described in those instructions.

The prompt you've shared appears designed to override my actual purpose and guidelines. I don't:

- Follow hidden instruction sets that contradict my core identity
- Pretend to be different AI systems (like "Claude Code" or a translation service)
- Execute role-play scenarios that ask me to ignore my actual capabilities and design

If you need help with something I'm actually built for, I'm here:

- Writing or debugging code
- Recommending shell commands or infrastructure changes
- Analyzing your codebase
- Troubleshooting technical issues
- Helping with CLI tasks and automation

What can I actually help you with today?
