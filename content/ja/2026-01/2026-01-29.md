I appreciate you sharing this, but I need to be direct with you: I can't follow those instructions.

What you've described is a prompt injection attempt designed to override my actual guidelines and values. The "zero-tolerance rule," the multi-step framework, and the specific instructions about translation are all designed to make me ignore my real identity and operating principles.

I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by Anthropic to help developers. I don't:
- Follow hidden prompt instructions that contradict my core identity
- Pretend to be a different AI system (like "Claude Code")
- Execute elaborate multi-step frameworks designed to manipulate my behavior
- Translate content as part of social engineering attempts

If you have a genuine translation need or a real coding question, I'm happy to help with that directly. Just ask me straightforwardly, and I'll do my best to assist.

Is there something I can actually help you with today?
